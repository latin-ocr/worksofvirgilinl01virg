Mopsus.
Qiae tibi, quae tali reddam pro carmine dona?
Nam neque me tantum venientis fibilus afistri,
Nec percuffajuvant fluCtu tam litora, nee quae

Hac te nos fragili donabimus ante cicuta. 85
Haec nos, Formosum Corydon ardebat Alexin ε

Ac tu sume pedum, quod, me curn saepe rogaret,
Non tulit Antigenes, (et erat tum dignus amari)
Formosum paribus nodis atque aere, Menalca. 90

109. Thefizme‚ δια] 'Tis inferred from this passage that
Virgil certainly means himself under the name of Menalcas;
and likewise, that by his mentioning only the subjeets of the
Palaemon and the Alexis, and not a syllable of the Tityrus,
that all these three Eclogues were written before the Tityrus ;
notwithstanding that Eclogue, usually, but erroneoussy, is
placed first in all editions. It is not improbable, that the

Alexis was publissied before the death of Julius Caesar, who Ι

might read and admire it.
