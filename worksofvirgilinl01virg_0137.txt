Ι MENALcAs.

In vain, Amyntas, you pretend in vain 105

¹ To love; you treat me with unkincl disdain‚

ἶ If while you· hold the bristly boat· at bay,

I keep the nets, nor {hare the dangerous day.

ἡ DAMoETAs.

ἓ Bid Phillis haste t’improve the genial mirth

J Of this the day that gave her shepherd birth; 110

J And when my heifer bleeds at Ceres’ feast,

J Iolas, corne thyself, and be a welcome guest!
MENALCAS.

Phillis o’er every other nymph I prize,

ἰ Oh ! how she took her leave with weeping eyes!

ῐ7 And as I went, “ Dear ffiepherd‚” oft she cry'd‚ 115

J* And many along adieu thro' the deep vales [he figh’d.

ᾗ DAMOETAS.

{‘ The wolf is fatal to the folded {heep3

With fatal force o'er trees loud tempests sweep5

Fata] the ruihing show'rs to ripening corn:

 

To me more fatal Amaryllis' scorn ἔ 121
MENALCAS.

Sweet are the vernal ss10w'rs to swelling seed5

The flow’ry arbute to the weanling kid;

The tender willows to the teeming herd ε

By me o’er'all Amyntas is preferr’d.
DAMOETAS.

Pollio approves, though rough, my rural reed ς 125

Muses, an heifer for your patron feed ἔ
MENALCAS.

Since Pollio deigns to build the lofty strain;

Feed him a bull that butt-ing spurns the plain.
DAMOETAS.

Let him who loves a Pollio’s sacred name

Gain what he loves, and {hare a Pollio's fame t 130

“ and tempestuous winds‚ are the ornament of Damoetas’s dis-
“ course. In that of Menalcas, we have favourable rains, and
'¹ an agreeable nouriihment to the·flocks.'{
