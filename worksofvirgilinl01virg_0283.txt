In several hues to {hine the apple loves 3

VHow many species deck Alcinous’ groves ἓ

What vast varieties each orchard bears,

In syrian, bergamot‚ and pounder pears ?

Nor the same grape Hesperia's vintage fills, 110
Which Lesbos gathers from IMIethymnia's hills.

Of Thafian vines, and Mareotic white,

One loves a fatten'd soil, and one a light ;

Best are the Psyt'nian when by Phoebus dry'd 3 114
Thin is Lageos' penetrating tide, [try'd 3
By which the faultering tongue‚ and staggering feet are
Purple there are, and grapes which early spring,

But in what strains thee, Rhaetic, shall I smg ?

‘Yet dare not thou with Falern juice contest !

Amminean wines for body are the best3 . 120
To these, ev’n Tmolus bends his cluster’d browe,

And, king of vine-clad hills, Phanaeus bows 3

By these is Argos’ leffer grape surpast,

Tho’ fam’d so much to stow, so long to last,

Nor thine‚ O Rhodes, I pass, whose streams afford 125
Libations to the Gods, and crown the board t

Nor thee, Bumastus, grape of plumpest fize ;

But can my song each various race comprise ?

He that cou’d each rehearse, the sands might count,
That from the Libyan waste in whirling eddies mount :
Or tell the billows as they beat the shores, 131
When all th’ Ionian sea with raging Boreas roars.

Nor every race will thrive in every ground t

Willows along the river-banks abound 3

While adders bud in wet and weeping plains, 135
The wild aih on the ridgy mountain reigns:

‘Myrtles the shore, the baleful eugh approves

Bleak blasts, and Bacchus sunny summits loves.

‹ Italy: and particularly at Florence. It has its name from its
ssmpe, each grape being like the teat of a cow; Varro half la-
tinises the word, where he calls it bumamma. Homswoarn.
