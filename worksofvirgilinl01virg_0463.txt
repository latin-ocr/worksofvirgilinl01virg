DIDACTIC POETRY. 427

Paulatim ver id nitidum, flos ille juventae
Disperii& vis illa animi 3 tum squalida tabes
Artus (horrendum J ) miseros obduxit, et alt&
Grandia turgebant saedis absceffibus ff.

Ulcera (prole divum pietatem ,s ) informia pulchros
Pascebant oculos, et diae lucis amorem,
Pafiebantque acri corrosas vulnere nares.

Illum omnes Ollique Deae, Eridanique puellae

concerning his way of life and method of paffing his time with
his family ; together with that to J.Turrianus on the death of his
sons. The two books, of his JosEPH are not equal to the syphilis.

† However the following lines are elegant and pretty, on
,the worms being turned into butterflies.

Haerent attonitae rerum novitate, nec audent
