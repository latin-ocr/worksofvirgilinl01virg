our old poet’s piRure of the spring, and the pleasures to
be enjoyed at that delicious season, is indeed not so high-
ly finished as Virgil's (Georg. ii. 323.) yet is very pleas-
ing to the mind, as it gives one so lively an idea of the
fimple and natural manners of those early ages.

EMPEDocLEs flourished about the 80th olympiad : he
was a native of Sicily, and wrote a poem on the nature
of things, and the four elements3 the loss of which, if
we may judge from some few noble fragments that remain,
we have great reason to regret. Even the severe Aristotle
speaks of hirn with great respee’c, and says, * that he was
very Homerical in his manner 3 that his style was forcible,
well laboured‚ and full of metaphors 3 and that he made
use of all the proper methods that could conduce to the
