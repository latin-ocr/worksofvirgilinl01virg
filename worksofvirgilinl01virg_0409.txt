Book 4. Tm Gzoamcs or Vmcn.. 373

The tainted juices, in this prison pent,
Begin to boil, and thro’ the bones ferment 3 360
-A wond'rousAswarm strait from the carcase crawls,
Of feetless and unfiniih’d animals ς
Anon their infant buzzing wings they try,
And more and more attempt the boundless sky z
At last embody'd from their birth-place pour, 36 5
Thick as from copious clouds a summer-ffiow’r,
Or flight of arrOWS‚ when with twanging bows,
The Parthians in fierce onset gall their foes.
What God, ye nine, this art disclos'd to man,
Say whence this great experiment began ? 370
Sad Aristaeus from sweet Tempe fled,
His bees with famine and diseases dead,
And at the spring of sacred Peneus· stood,
Thus plaining to his sea-green parent stood.
Mother, Cyrene ! mother, you who keep 375
Your wat’ry court beneath this crystal deep,
Why did you bear me of a race divine,
Yet stain with sorrows my celestial line ?
If Phoebus be my sire, as you relate,
Why am I doom'd the sport of angry Fate ? 380
How have I lost, O how ! your former love ?
Why did you bid me hope to rise to heav'n above ?
Lo ! all Ι gain'd‚ by cattle, fields and corn,
(Those works which best this mortal state adorn)
The fruits of toil and thought intense are lost, 385
Tho' for my mother I a goddess boast ἔ
Come then, with your own hand uproot my groves,
My stans and stables burn, infe& my droves,
My harvests murder, cut each bioorning vine,
Since at my rifing honours you repine. 39>
His wondering mother heard the mournful found,
Low in the chambers of the wavcs profound.
