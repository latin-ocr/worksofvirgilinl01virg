DIDACTIC POETR-Y. 433

Rides on the volley'd lightning thro' the heav’ns3
Or yok’d with whirlwinds and the northern blast,
Sweeps *the long tracst of day. Then high she soars
The blue profound, and hov'ring o’er the sun
Beholds him pourihg the redundant stream

Of light3 beholds his unrelenting sway

Bend the relucstant planets and absolve

The fated rounds of time. Thence far effus’d
She darts her swiftness up the long career

Of devious comete 3 through its burning signs
Exulting circles the perennial wheel

Of nature, and looks back on all the stus,
Whose blended light, as with a milky zone,
Invests the orient. Now amaz'd she views

Th’ empyreal waste, where happy spirits hold,
Beyond this concave heav'n, their calm abode ;
And fields of radiance‚ whose unfading light.

Has travell'd the profound fix thousand years,
Nor yet arrives in sight of mortal things 3

Ev'n on the barriers of the world untir'd

..She meditates th' eternal depth below 3 ’

Tin, half recoiling‚ down the headlong steep
She plunges 3 soon o'erwhelm’d and swallow’d up
In that immense of being. There her hopes

Rest at the fated goal.

-—- What need words
To paint its power? For this, the daring youth
Breaks from his weeping mother’s anxious arms,
In foreign elimes to rove : the penfive fage
Heedless of sseep, or midnight's harmful damp,
Hangs' o’er the fickly tapes 3 and untir’d
The virgin follows, with inchanted step,

The mazes'of some wild and wond’rous tale
