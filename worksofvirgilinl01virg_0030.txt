I begin now most senfibly to perceive the soree of that
saying of a French author: “ When a man writes,
‘⁶ he ought to animate himself with the thoughts of
σς pleastng all the world 5 but he is to renounce that
“ hope, the very moment the hook goes out of his

“ hands.’'

In this edition are now first added, stveral remarks
and observations‚ taken from an edition of Virga,
puhlifhed at Ln1ps1C, 1771, in four volumes, ottavo,
by the learned and ingenious CHRISTOPHER. GoTT.
HEYNE. The title of EXCURSUS, which he has given
to some of the longer of these observations‚ is here
preserved. ' And it was thought to be no objettion to
the insertion of them, that some of them contained roff
marks contradidory to what had been before advanced
in thefie volumes. In criticifin‚ there will ever be an

usefal variety of opinione,-
