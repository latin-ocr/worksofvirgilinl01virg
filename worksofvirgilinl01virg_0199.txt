ECLOGUE THE NINTH.

MOERIS.

LchAS, Momm.

LYCIDAS.
AY, Moeris, to the city dost thou haste ?
Momm.
O Lycidas, the day's arriv’d at last, ⁵
When the fierce stranger, breathing rage, shall say,
These fields are mine, ye veteran hinds away !
To whom, by Fortune crush’d, Q’ercorne by fear, 5
These kidsr (a curse attend them l) must I bear.
chmAs,
Sure I had heard, that where yon’ hills descend,
And to the vale their ssoping summits bend,
Down to the stream and ancient broken beech,
Far as the confines of his pastures reach, 10

, Menalcas sav'd his all by skilful strains.

MOERIS.

Such was the tale among the Mantuan swains;

But verse 'mid dreadful war's mad turmam, proves

As weak and powerlesS, as Dodona's doves,

When the fierce, hungry eagle first they spy‚ 15

Fun on their heads impetuous dart from high.

The boding raven from an hollow tree,

Warn'd us to cease the strife, and quick agree3

Else of our liberty, nay life, depriv’d‚

Nor Moerisnor Menalcas had surviv'd. 20
LchAs.

What tage the ruthless soldier could induce

To hurt the sweetest favourite of the muse?
