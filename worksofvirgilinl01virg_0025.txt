Purmomr DenicA‘rroN. xv

In transsating this passage, Mr. Dryden hath made
Sabinos lean his head upon his pruning hook,
which as it would appear absurd in a statue or
pistum, cannot be proper in a poetical descrip-
tion.

On a [hort pruning hook his head reclines,
And studioussy surveys his generous wines.
Dryden‚ 249.

There stood Sabinus, plantet of the vines, }

Sabinus there who prest the foaming wine,
Extends the hook that prun’d the genereus vine.
Pitt, ‘2210

7. One great occafion of faults in Mr. Dryden in
relation to the imaginary beings of the ancients‚
is owing to his not being sufficiently acquainted
with (or not recollesting) their particular qualities5
rank and dignity; and this makes him sometimes
vary from his original.

“ Ecce furens animis aderat Tirynthius, omnemque
Accffcm lqstmm, huc ora fhrebat et illuc,
Dentibus infrendens. ‘Ter totum fervidus ira*
Lustrat Aventini montem 3 ter saxea tentat

Limina nequicquam 3 terfeſjits valle refi’dit.
AEn. 8. 228.

The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast,
The fierce avenger came with bounding haste i
Survey’d the mouth of the forbidden hold,

And here andrthere his raging eyes he roll’d3

He gnassi’d his teeth‚ and* thrice he compast round

With winged speed the circuit of the ground.
