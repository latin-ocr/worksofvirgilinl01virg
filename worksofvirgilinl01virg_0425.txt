Book 4. Tm. G50R01cs 01·- Vmctz. 389

Adieu ! no longer must thou bless my sight-—

I go ! I smk ! involv’d in thickest night ἔ

Ϊη vain I stretch my feeble arms to join

Thy fond embrace3 ah ! now no longer thine ἔ 595
swift from his ardent gaze, while thus she spoke,

She vanish'd into air, like subtile smoke,

And left him catching at her empty ghost,

Defiring much to say, in speechless sorrow lost :

The rigid ferryman of hell no more 600
Would deign to waft him to the gloomy shore :

What should he do ? where turn ἒ how seek relies ἒ
Twice lost his confort, how appease his grief?

How move the Manes, with what doleful note ?

She sail’d, already cold‚ in Charon's boat. 605
For seven long months, by desart Strymon’s fide,
Beneath a lofty rock, he mourn'd his bride,

And stretcht in gelid cavernS, with his song

Made tygers tame, and drew hard oaks along.

As Philomel in poplar shades, alone, 610
For her lost offspring pours a mother‘s moan‚

Which some rough ploughman marking for his prey,
From the warm nest, unfledg'd, hath dragg'd away ς
Percht on a bough, she all night long complains,

And fills the grove with sad repeated strains. 615
No second fair, no nuptia! rites could move,

Nought soften his distra&ed mind to love ε

The Hyperborean ice he wander’d o'er‚

And solitary roam’d round Tanais' shore,

And Scythia's desarts of eternal frost, 620
Lamenting his lost bride, and Pluto's favours lost.

The Thracian dames enrag'd to be despis'd‚

At Bacchus’ midnight feasts they solemniz'd,

Inspir’d with frantie fury seiz'd the swain,

And strew’d his mangled carcase o’er the plain z 625
His pale head from his ivory shoulders torn,

Adown Oeagrian Hebrus' tide was borne 5
