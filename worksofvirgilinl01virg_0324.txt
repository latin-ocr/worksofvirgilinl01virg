290 Ρ. VIRGILII MARoNIS Gssozzmcm Lib, 30

Et viridi in campo templum de marmore ponam-
Propter aquarn, tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat
Mincius, ac tenera praetexit arundine ripas.

19. Spreading· wide his ling'rifrg waters.]- This description Of
the Mincio is as exact as poffible; the force of it lies chiefly in
the epithets‚ tardis, ingens the wide spreading and almost
stagnation of the river, which forms the lake of Mantua.

17. <These hands] Mr. Hurd, in his notes on Horace’s
Epistle to Augustus‚,hath discoursed so entertainingly on the
introdufiory lines of this third book, that it was though-t pro-
per to insert the following extra& from that judicious work:

On the idea of the Apotheosis, which was the usual mode of
flattery in the Augustan age, but, as having the countenance
of public authority, sometimes inartificially enough employed, ν
Virgil hath projected one of the noblest allegories in ancient
poetry, and at the same time hath given to it all the force of
just'compliment, the occafion itself allowed. Each of these ex-
cellencies was to be expected from his talents. For as his ge·-
nius led him to thesuhlz'me3 so his exquisite judgment would
instruct him to palliate this bold fiction, and qualify as much as
pcflible‚ the ssiocking adulation impiied in it. So singular a
beauty deserves to be ssiewn at large.

The thirdGEORcrc sets out with an apology for the low
and simple argument of that· work, which yet the poet esteern—
ed, for its novelty, preferable to the sublimes, but trite, themes
of the Greek writers. Not but he intended, on some future
occasion, to adorn a nobler subject. This was the great plan
of the Aeneis, which he now prefigures and unfolds at large.
For, taking advantage of the noblest privilege of his art, he
breaks away, in a fit of prophetie enthufiasrn, to predi& his
successes in this projecied enterprize‚ and under the imagery of
the ancient triumph, which comprehends or suggestam the ima-
gination, whatever is most august in human affairs, to delineate
the future glories of this ambitious defign. The whole con—
ception, as we shall see, is of the utmost grandeur and mag· ¹
nificence3 though, according to the usual management of the ¹
poet (which as not being apprehended by his critics‚ hath fur·
nished occasion even to the best of them to charge him with a
want of the sublime) he hath contrived to sosten andfamiliarize
its appearance to the reader3 by the arti-“ul manner in which

it is introduced. lt stands thus :

 

Tentanda ‘via cst, qua me quoque poſjfm

Tollere humo, V1C'r0RQJ E virtim volitare per ora.

The idea of viny, thus casually dropped, he makes the basis
of his imagery ; which, by means of this gradual preparation,
effers itsclf easily to the apprehension, though it thereby loses,
