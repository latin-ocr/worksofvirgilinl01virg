These fietce contentions‚ this pernicious fray,
A little dust flung upwards will allay.
When now both chiefs have left the doubtful strife,
The vanquyissi'd wretch must yield his forfeit life;
Lest he consume the stores, an useless drone5 105
While uncontroll'd the vietor mounts the throne.
'Two diff'rent kinds of regal bees behold!
The better bears a cont that glows with gold ς
More delicate proportions grace his frume,
And radiant scales o'er all 'nis body flame : 110
While in the other, ssoth’s foul hucs prevail‚
Groveling he scarce his breadth of paunch can trail-
Alike a different form the people wear,
These squalid to the sight, and rough appear:
As when the traveller‚ all spent with thirst‚ 11 ς
Spits from parch’d lips the froth-attemper‘d dust-
The better race refulgent hues unfold,
Bedropt with equal spots of glistening gold;
At stated seasons‚ these shall plenteous pour
Ι F rom their swoln combs the sweet neoareous show’x· 5 120
Yet pure as sweet‚ and potent to diffuse
Ν ew flavours mild o'et Bacchus’ harsher juice3„
But when the swarms in aether idly play,
‚And from> their emptied hives uncertain stray3
'From the vaIn sport their giddy minds restrain3 125
Nor great, to check the fugitives, the pain :
Be it thy care, from these high reverenc’d kings,
Conduecors of their ssight, to clip the wings 3
The troops to march without their leaders fear,
Nor dare the standard from the camp to bear. 130
‘Let gardens gay, with saffron flowers‚ invite
The fickle wanderers‚ and retard their ssight:

owder. This is more like Cervantes than virgil: and in-
ζ {ced there' is an air of burlesque poetry throughout the whole
' poem of CYDER, much resembling his Summo Ξῌιιιικο, -’
