Homer: *that he found out vach. woRns. ‹ If the
arrows which are impatimf 'to destr0y‚ and the
spears that thirsi to drink blood, are so deservedly
admired in the iliad, virgil doubtless merits equal
praise, for giving life and feeling, love and hatred,
hope a'nd fear, wonder and ambition, to plants
and to trees, and to the very earth itself: and for ’
exalting his favourite inseeks, by endowing them
with reason, pasfions, artS, and civil government.
To use Aristocle’s expreffion, Every thing in this
poem hath manners, and all the creation is ani-
mated.

But ahs! [lnce this is the case, what must be-
come of a transsator of the Georgics, writing in a
language not half so losty, so founding, 01· so
elegant as the Latin, incapable of admitting many ·
of its best and boldest figureS, and heavily settered
with the Gothic shackles of rhyme! Is not this
endeavouring to imitate a palace of porphyry with
flints and bricks? A poem whose excellence pecu-
liarly confists in the graces of diffion is far more
difficult to be transsated, than a work where senti-
ment, or paffion, or imagination, is chiefly dis-
played. So that I fear we can receive but a faint
notIOn of the beauty of the ‚Georgics from any
English verfion of them. An engraving may in-
deed faithfuliy represent the subject, but can give
no idea of the coleuring of one of Titian's land-
scapes. Bestdcs, the meanncss of the terms ,οἱ
