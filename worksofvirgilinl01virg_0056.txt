26 THE LIFE OF VIRGIL.

quently ran into the ihops to prevent being gazed a't in ᾖ

the streets of Rome3 yet so honoured by the Romans, ,

think, that it is falsely attributed ro hirn3 and because we have

pictures of Virgil drawn at full length, and much less to be y

disputed. What I mean are two pictures‚ placed before two of
his EclogueS, in one of those old manuscripts of his works, in
’ the Vatican library. You see him there represented with a sweet,

 

modest countenance, and dreffed particularly neat. These pic·

tures, if you will allow of their authority, (and I know of no
other that can pretend to near so good an one) may serve per· ,ἦ
haps to give us the true sense of an expreffion in Statius, and to Ξ
save a passage in Horace from the misrepresentations of his com· ».

mentatum. Statius, in speaking of Virgil, applies the epithet ⁷

of torvus to him ; whence some have been apt to imagine, that ἶ
Virgil had a stern or sour look. But isone ought to trust more Ξ

to this picture than to the commentatas, we stxould perhaps
understand that expreflion of his writings rather than of his

personage, with which it will by no means agree: whereas if ⁴

'it be applied to his works‚ it may fignify the dignity and ma·

jesty of them, which will agree with the context, and the occa· f

sion on which Statius uses that expreffion, as much as in the ,

*other sense it would be foreign to both. The paffage I had
in my eye from Horace, is where that poet is speaking of a man
who had some little faults, mixed with more material excellen-
cies, which might well enough conceal them, at least to every
good-natured observer. The faults or defec‘ts he mentions are,
that he was a little too paffionate, somewhat ungenteel in his
conversation, and ill-dressed. Here, say the commentators, one
sees an instance of the ssy way that Horace had of touching 011

the faults of his best friends, even whilst he is commending υ

them3 and the friend here touched upon they will have to be
Virgil. The lines are as follows:

Iracundior est paul03 minis aptus acutis
Naribus horum hominum .· rideri poffit‚ eb quod
Rusticius tonso toga defluit, {sss male laxus

In sede calceus haeret

 

Hor. Lib. i. Sat. iii. 32.
