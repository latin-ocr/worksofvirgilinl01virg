Book 4.· 'rma Gaoncxcs or Vnam.- 381

When the parch’d herbage fades with mid-day heat, 47 5
And fainting cattle to cool shades retreat,

Myself will l'ead thee to the close abode,

Where stretcht in ssumber, thou may'st seize the god.
Instant he'll try, elufive of the rape,

'The varied force of every savage shape3 ⁷480
Become ζει bristly boar, or tyger fell,

Or· like a scaly bloated dragon swell 3

Like a gaunt lion shake a tawny mane,

Or in loud crackling fire escape thy chain 3

'Or while thou closely grasp’st thy fraudful prey, 485
Chang'd to a flowing stream glide swift away.

Yet still retentive with redoubled might,

Thro' each vain fleeting form constrain his flight 3

Tin the'· same shape, all changes past, appear,

‘That ere the senior ssept, thou saw'st him wear. 490
She spoke, and o'er him rich ambrofia ss1ed,

With liquid odours bath'd his breathing head,

And thro' his glowing limbs celestial vigour spread.

Deep in the mountain lies a spacious cave,
Worn by the workings of the restless wave, 495
Whither vast waters* drive before the wind,
And ihatter’d ships commodious fhelter find.
There, far within av gret, old Proteus dwells,
And draws a vast rock o'er his secret cells. Ι .
She plac‘d her son beneath the darksome roof, 500
Herself, involv’d in clouds, retires aloof.

Now rabid Sirius scorcht the gasping plains,
And burnt intense the panting Indian swains3
In his 'mid course the sun all fiery stood,
Parcht was the grass3 the rivers bak'd to mud3 50 5
When Proteus, weary of the waterS, fought
‘The cool retirement of his 'custom'd grott 3

Therein is caten out an hollow cave,

That seemes rough masons hand with engines keene

Had long while laboured it to engrave.
