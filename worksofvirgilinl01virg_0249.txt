Book 1. THE Gssonoxcs 01·- Vmon„ 215

To hurry formal, when the sky is fair, 310
He may with prudent forefight now prepare ;

Now to a point the blunted share may beat 3

Scoop troughs from trees, marl< floclffi, or sacks of wheat3
Long spars and forks may {harpen3 or supply

‚Amerian twigs the creepinsf vinc to tie ; 315

With Rubean rods now basksts may be wove, [stove.
Now grain be ground with {lones3 now parch'd upon the
Nor do the laws of man, or Gods above,

On sacred days some labours disapprove3

No solemn rite should e’er forbid the swain, 323
The mead with sudden streams o’erfiow'd, to drain:

To raise strong fences for the springing corn,

To lay the snare for birds, to burn the thorn3

Nor to sorbeas to wash ,the blenting flock,

And soundly plunge thern in the healthy brook. ’ 325
Oft’ the ssow ass’s fides the driver loads,

With oil, or apples, or domestic gomis,

And for the mill brings an indented stone,

Or with black lumps of pitch returns from town.

For various works behold the moon declare 330
Some days more fortunate—the fifth beware!

Pale Orcus and the Furies then sprung forth,
ἱ Iapetus and Cosass having earth .

Produc’d, a foul abominable birth !

And fierce Typhoeus, Jove-who dar’d defy, 335
-Leagu’d in conj unfffflon dire to storm the sky ! ¹ ⁸
Offa on Pelion, thriee ε’ uplift they strove,

And high o’er nodding Ossa roll above

The line too labours, and the words move ssow.

The verse cannot be read without making pauses; so ju-
