said also, that Virgil made all his Eclogues in three “·
years. Therefore Cicero could not hear any one of
them. But, in the original it is perfecit, that is, he per-
feeted thern 3 he made them fit to appear. Thus this
Eclogue might have been prior to the Tityrus, and Cythe-
ris might· have recited it in the presence of Cicero.

I beg to add a conjezsture purely my own, and submit
the decifion of it entirely to the learned. Cicero having
heard this Eclogue, cried out in an ecstasy of admiration,
that the author of it was

 

lAagnaespes altera Romae,

the stconcl great hope of Rome, esteeming himself, say the
Commentators, to be the first. I understand the words in
a far different sense. The subje& of this piece‚ we should
remember, was an account of the Epicurean Philosophy
both natural and moral, which had been but lately beauti-
fully illustrated by Lucretiu83 an author whom Cicero
was so eminently fond of, as to revise and publisl] his
work. Upon hearing therefore the beautiful verses of
virgil on the same subject, Cicero exclaimed to this pur-
pose ; Beholcl another great genius rfflng up amongst us, who
will prove a second Lucretius. This interpretation at once
takes away the imputation of vanity of which Cicero has
been accused for using these words, making the Spes altera
refer entirely to Lucretius. And befides‚ the expreffion
of Spes necessarily implies something future and inc7·eafi.2zg;
whereas Cicero was at that time arrived at a maturity of
fame and abilities: neither do I perceive the propriety of
the connexion, in joining an eminent poet with an emi-
nent orator. 'Tis observable that Virgil inserted this he-
mistich afterwards in the twelfth book of his AEneid, and
applied the words to Ascanius.

Dion Ca'ffius relates‚ in his forty-seventh book, that in
the year of Rome 712 the Triumvirs, Antony‚ Gemmas,
and Lepidus, ereeted and consecrated a temple to Julius
