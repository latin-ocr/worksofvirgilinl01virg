⁸Now, hallowed Pales, I resound thy reign,

O grant thinc aid l in more majestic straim

first, I command, beneath the fostering (hed, 375¹

'Till sprIng returns, thy sheep with grass be fed ι

Strew fern hemath, lest from the piercing ice ’

O'er their soft skins the loathsome scabs arise-

Nor lest, thy goats with leafy fodder fill,

And give thern water recent from the rill. ‘380'

When cold Aquarius‘, from his cloudy sphere,

Pours his last drops upon the' parting year.

Nor less the profit that the goat repays.

Yet these afford more numerous increase ;

And, as their swelling dags you dmin the more,

To cover tems, or cloath the mariner.

And o’er the threfhold scarce their strutting dugs sustain.

rGladly supply them with the leafy spray,

Nor in bleak winter's reign refuse thy hoarded hay. 400
