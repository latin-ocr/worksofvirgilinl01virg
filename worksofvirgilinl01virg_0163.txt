Ecl. 5. Tm: EcLocmzs or Vmon„ 133

Mopsus.
What thanks‚ what recompence‚ can my weak lay 100
For such exalted strains as thine repay? ἦ
Not from fresh whispers of the southern breeze,
Nor gentle daffiings of the calmest seas,
Nor from the murmuring rills, such joys I feel,
- That gliding down the pebbly vallies steal ! 105
MENALcAs.
But first receive this ssender pipe, the same
That told poor Corydon's unpitied flame,
Who vainly fought Alexis’ heart to move :
The same with which Damoetas fondly strove.
Mopsus.
And thou, Menalcas, take this well-form’d crook, 110
With polish’d joints adorn’d and brazen hook 3
Which ev'n Antigenes could ne'er obtain
Tho' worthy to be lov’d, a beauteous swain.
