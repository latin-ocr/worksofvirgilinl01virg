120 Ρ. V1RG1L11 MAaoms Bucoch. Ecl. 4.

Matri longa decem tulerunt fastidia menses.
Incipe, parve puer: cui non risere parentes,
Nec deus hunc mensa, dea nec dignata cubili est.

7¹· Smile not.] Those who understand this passage of the
child, strain the verb cognoscere, to fignify that the child stmuld
own, or acknowledge his mother, by smiling on her: but I do
not find any instance of its having been used in that sense.

In the.. next line, the making of the last syllable but one
short talffrunt, is a poetical lieence not very unusual ; thus we
read stetb‘runt et misqurunt‚ for stetZrunt et miscuirunt3 so that
there is no ‚occafion to read tulerint, as some have done with*-
out any good authority.
