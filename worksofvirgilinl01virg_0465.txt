DIDAchc POETRY. 429

first regular modern tragedy‚ in blank verse, his Sophonis-
ba 3 as Ruccellai himself produced the second that was seen
in Italy, entituled‚ Rosmunda.

Before Ι conclude these refleffions, it will, I presume,
be expected thatI speak a few words on the didaetic poets
of our own nation.

PHILIPs's Cyder is a very close and happy imitation of
the Georgic, and conveys to us the fullest idea of
Virgil’s manner: whom he hath exad’dy followed in a
pregnant brevity of style, in throwing in frequent moral
reflec‘tions, in varying the method of giving his precepts,
in his digreffions‚ and in his happy address in returning
again to his subject 3 in his knowledge and love of philo-
sophy, medicine, agriculture and antiquity‚ and in a cer·
tain primaeval fimplicity of manner3‚ which is so con-
spicuous in both.

If there be any fault 1‘n Philips, it is, perhaps, his in-
, sertion of many images that excite laughter‚ and are con-
trary to the majest-y of the didaffic Muse 3 and his having
used too many elifions, exotique and antique expreffions, and
transpositione, under the notion of strengthening his verse,
and of resembling Milton3 who, by the way, is not so
uniformly obsolete and difficult in his dietion, as is some-
times imagined3 but makes use of these uncommon and
unfamiliar phrases chiefly when he is describing things
that lie out of the compass of nature, and that are mar-
vellous and strange, such as hell, chaos, and heaven.

SOMERVILLE in his Cmoee, writes with all the spirit
and fire of an eager sportsman.

Slumber secure with happy dreams amus'd-—-·
