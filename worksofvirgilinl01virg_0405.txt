Galbanean odours here I shall advise ;

And thro' a reed to pour the sweet supplies 310

Of golden honey, to invite the taste ⁵

Of the fick nation, to their known repast z

Bruis’d galis, dry'd roses, thyme and centuary join,

And raifins ripen'd on the Pfithian vine.

Befides, in meads the plant Amellus grows, 315

And from one root thick stalks profusely throws, }

Which eafily the wand'ring fimpler know's :

Its top a flow’r of golden hue displays‚

Its leaves are edg’d with violet-tinecur’d rays;

Rough is the taste 3 round many an holy shrine 320

The sacred priests its beauteous foliage twine z

This, where meand'ring Mella laves the plains‚

Or in the new-shorn valley, seek the swains 3

Its roots infuse in wine, and at their door

In bass<ets hang the medicated store. 3² 5
But ffiould your stock decay thro’ dire disease,

Nor hope remain new families to mise,

Hear the strange secret Ι {hall now impart‚

The great Arcadian master's matchless art ;

Au art to reproduce th’ exhausted store 330

From a ssain bullock's putrifying goret }

1³11 to its distant source the wond’rous tale explore.
WVhere happy the Canopian nation dwells,

Where Nile with genial inundation swells‚

Where swains‚ the meadows while he largely floats, 335

Around his pastures glide in painted boats‚

From tawny India while he rollsvhis tides‘‚

And into seven huge mouths his* stream divides,

And preffing close on quiver’d Perfia’s clime

Green Egypt fattens with prolific ssime: ᾖ 340

ἓτετε the Nile is divided to form the Delta. Δ. The circum-
nce,

Circum pidis vehitur sua rura phaselis,

ij a very agreeable pisture of that country, which'during the
inundatlon of the Nile resembles a vast level lake.
