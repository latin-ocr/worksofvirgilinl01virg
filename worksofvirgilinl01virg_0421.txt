Book 4. THE Gaonorcs or Viaca. 385

She from thy arms, by headlong fear missed,

Swift o’er the river’s verdant margin fled 3 545
Nor at her feet the fated maid descry'd

The dreadful snake that kept its grassy fide.

But with loud shrieks her fister-dryads moan’d,

And high Pangaea’s utmost mountains groan’d3

Their eries to Rhodope and Thrace were borne, 550
The Getae, Hebrus, Orithyia mourn.

He on the desart shore all lonely griev'd,

And with his concave 1he11 his love-fick heart reliev'd ς
To thee, sweet wife, still pour’d the piteous lay,

Thee, sung at dawning, thee at closmg day ! 555
Ev’n hell's wide jaws he ventur'd to explore,

Deep gates of Dis, and Death's tremendous shore ;
Down to the Manes went, and chearless plains, [reigns 3
The grove where horror frowns, and hell‘s dread monarch

“Orpheus's mistresspwas timim. The powers of it are en.
chanting. It lulls the reason, and raises the fancy in so agree-
able a manner, that we forget ourselves while it lasts. The
mind turns dissolute and gay, and hugs itself in all the deluding
prospects and fond wishes of a golden dream. Whilst every
accent is warbled over by a charming voice, a filly song ap-
pears sound morality, and the very words of the opera pass for
sense, in presence of their accompagnement. But no sooner
does the mufie cease, than the charm is undone, and. the fan-
cies disappear. The first sober look we take of it breaks the
spell ; and we are hurried back with some regret to the com-
mon dull road of life, when the florid illufion is vaniffi’d.
