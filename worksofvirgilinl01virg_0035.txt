THE LIFE OF VIRGIL. 5

When first young Maro sung of kings and wars,

Ere warning Phoebus touch’d his trembling ears,

Perhaps he seem'd above the critic's law,

And but from nature's fountains scorn'd to draW3
ι But when t' examine every part he came,

tation of the Ἐςαε-ὺς of Theocritus, and been struck with
admiration of the promising genius ofits author. Poffi-
bly the Palaemon was his second performance3 it is a
close imitation of the fourth and fifth Idyllia of Theo-
crltus.

May I venture to mention the Silenus as the next com-
position in order of time ? This fine piecc of philosophy
is said to have been publicly recited on the stage by
Cytheris, a celebrated comedian, remarkable for a sweet-
ness and propriety of speaking, inl'omuch that Catrou
imagines that expreffion in the tenth Eclogue, Quae legat
ipsa Lycorisndoes not only fignify that he may write such⁴
