Great guardian queen, of Ida's hil'ls and wood's4
supreme, majestic mother of the gods !

Whose strong defence proud towerIng cities share,
While roaring lions whirl thy mighty car.

Pitt, 3⁶5⁶

5, Hic, ubi disjenas moles, avulsaque saxis
Saxa vides, mixtoque undantem pulvere fumum,
Neptunus muros, magnoque emota tridenti
Fundamenta quatit3 totamque ab sedibus urbem
Eruit— AEn. 2. 612⁴·

This exalted passage Mr. Dryden has thus trans⁶
lated:

Below the wall’s foundation drives his mace,

Amid that smokher‚ Neptune holds his place,
And heaves the building from the solid base. 829 }

Where it is to be observed he has divested Neptune

of his trident, and equipped him with a Gothic ,

mace. That Pitt hath restored the god his prod
per instgnia, is much the least part of his praise in
ghis sublime paffage :

Stone rent from stone, a dreadful ruin lies,
And black with rolling smoke the dusty whirlwind flies:
There Neptune’s trident breaks the bulwarks down,

There from her bafis heaves the trembling town.
Pitt, 8120«

Where yon’ rude piles of ssxatter’d ramparts rise, }

V itisator‚ curvam strvans sub imagine falcem.
