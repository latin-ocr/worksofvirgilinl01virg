in those occafional epzsodes, which he should consecrate to his
more immediate honour3 and finally, that he would provide
the richest texture of his fancy, for a covering to that ad'mired¹
image of his virtues, which was to make the' sovereign pride
and glory of his poem. The choiee of the inwoven Erimus,
for the support of his wil, is well accounted for by those, who>
tell us, that Augustus was proud to have a number of these to
serve about him in quality of ssaves.

The ornaments of the DooRs of this delubrum, on which
the sculptor used to lavish all the riehes of his art, are next de:-¹
lineated.

’ In foribuspugnam ex auro solidoque elephanto
Gangaridum faciam, vi3307*is'qzce'ar772a Qirini .·
Atque hic undantem befflo, magnumque fluentem
Nilum, ac navali ficrgcntis aere colunmas.
Addam urbis Aſsae domitas, pulsiemque Niphaten,
fidentemque fuga Parthum vmfisque sagittis,

Et duo rapta manu diverfi ex hoste tropaea,
Bisque triumphatas utroque ab litore gentis.

Here the covering of the figure is too thin to hide the literal
meaning from the commonest reader, who sees, that the several
triumphs of Caesar, here recorded in sculpture, are those, which
the poet bath taken so much pains to finish, and hath occasion-
ally inserted, as it were, in miniature, in several places of his
poem. Let him only turn to the prophetie speech ofAnchises’
[hade in the VIth, and to the description of the {hield in the
VIIIth book. ¹

Hitherto we have contemplated the decor-:itioris of the shrine¹⁸
i. c. such as bear a more dire& and immediate reference to the
honour of Caesar. We are now presented with a view of the
remote surrounding ornaments of the temple. These are the
illustrioris Trojan chiefs, whose story was to furniih the materi-
als, or, more properly,> to form the body and case, as it were,
of this august stmfturess They are also connee'ted with the idol
deity of the place by the closest ties of relationship, the Jiilian
family affee‘ti'ng to derive its pcdigree from this proud original.
'she poet then, in his arrangement of these additional figureS,
with admirable judgment, completes and rounds the emlre
fiction. ⁴ ⁴

what the great archite& had, at the expence of so mue-h art

the poet personalizes‚ shuddering at the view of suit-h ῖὲίῑῐὶἐ
