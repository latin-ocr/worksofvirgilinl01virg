Ῐ Or melt the mass in summer's scorching beams;

Baneful alike to bees are both extremes.

For this, around the chinks, by nature led, 45
Soft wax and flow'rs and fucus thick they spread :

For this, their stores with potent glews enrich,

More tough than bird—lime or Idean pitch.

And oft in eaverns, as tradition tells,

They fix their bower, and form their secret cells ; 50
Oft in cleft stones their boarded sweets are laid,

Or moss-green oaken trunks with age decay’d.

Thou too with mud the chinky fides o’erlay,

And thinly {hade them with the leafy spray.

Nor by their walls let yews unwholesome grow, 55
Nor let the red'ning crabs in embers glow‚

ζ’ Ne’er trust them near the fen, or stagnate flood,
Nor rank pernicious stench of reeking mud,
{A Nor where the voice from hollow rocks rebounds,

And hill to hill returns the mimic sounds. 60-
For what remains, when the bright sun hath driv'n

Pale winter down, and op'd the smiiing heav'n

With cloudless lustre‚ strait abroad they rove,

Around each lawn, around each verdant grove,

And fip the purple flowers, and lightly skirn 65

Across the dimpled brook and river's brim :

Hence inexpreffive fondness fills their breast,

For their young progeny and rising nest 3

With joy their waxen labours they renew‚'

Thick’ning to honey their nefflareous dew. 70
Burst from their cells if a young troop be seen,

That sails exulting through the blue serene,

Driv’n by the winds, in clouds condens'd and dark,

Observe thern close, the paths they steer remark ;

They seek fresh fountains, and thick ihady bowers‚ 75

⁸ ’Tis then the time to scatter fragrant flowers,
