This plague, the just revenge of guilty love,
To frantie rage th' Inachian heifer drove. 209
More thick they swarm, when glows the noon-tide beat,
Then shift thy pregnant herd to some sequester'd seat 3
Or drive thern forth, when dawns the purple light,
Or Hesper gilds with glittering stars the night.
When now the dam has felt Lucina’s pains,
A fartner care to rear the calf remains ; 215
On each betimes, they print the branding fise,
To note the name‚' the lineage, and the fire.
Let this be doom'd to propagate the breed 3
This at the sacred shrine a vicTtim bleed ε
But that be destin'd in the field to ton, 22·
Break the stiff clods, and cleave the stubborn soil 3
The rest nnmark'd‚ as frolic leisure leads,
⁴Wztnton, ingloriou8‚ o’er the graffy meads.
The steers allotted to the shining' ssmre,
Observe to teach and tame with timely care; 22'5
'While now their tender years correE’don bear.
Bind thern with coliars from the tender spray,
And when their neeks the servile band obey 3
conae& two well-match’d bullocks in the trace‚
And bid them'learn in pairs the plain to pace; ²30
Oft let thern draw the waggon’s empty load,
Whose wheels scarce print the dust, or mark the road :
Next let them smoke beneath th' incumbent mass,
Join'd to the becchen axle, bound with brass.
Mean time thy unyok’d young not only feed 235
With grass and willow-leaves‚ or marshy weed ς
But crop with careful hand the nodding ears ς
Nor let the dam, as erst in ancient years,
Contribute to the pail her milky load;
Be all her udder on her calf bestow’d. 240
But if thy bosom burn in ranks of war
To lead the marstiall’d host, or urge the car,
