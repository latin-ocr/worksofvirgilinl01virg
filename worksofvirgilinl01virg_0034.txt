4 THE LIFE oF V1RG1L.

And again,

Et quae tanta fuit Romam tibi causa videndi ,Ρ
Libertas

 

For tho' Virgil is said to represent himself under the
person of Tityrus, yet this ignorancc of the largeness·
of the city might be counterfeited‚ and thrown in, as a
natural stroke of pastoral simplicity‚ and may perhaps be
justly confidered as asentiment: rather beautifully poetical ’
than striffly true.

’ We cannot imagine that such an exalted genius as Vir-

- gil was blest with, could lie long unaetive and unexerted.
We are told accordingly, that in the warmth of early
youth, he framed a noble defign, and boldly intended to
write a poem on the Wars of Rome3 but after some at-
*ternpts‚ he was discouraged from proceeding, by the
roughness and asperity of the old Roman names, which
horridly disgusted so delicate an ear. That great master
of verse (says a lively writer) found it difficult to put such
harss] words, as Vibius Caudex, Tanaquil, Lucumo, or ,

Decius Mus into his poetry. Some of the names of ἶ

towns could absolutely find no place in heroic mea-

sure. They were almost as frightful as Boileau’s VVoer- ,ἶ
den, or the hideous Wurts‚· of whose name he so woefully 3:

complains as quite scaring his muse.

Des villas que tu prens les noms durs et barbares,
N ’off'rent de toutes partes que fillahes bizarres .·

Et qui peut sans fumir abordcr Woerden‚

-Qel vers ne tomberoit au fi’ul nom de Hensden?

Wurts, l'aspoir du pass, et l'appui de ces murs, ἢ

Wurts—-Ah quel nom, Grand Rei, quel HeHor que ce
Wurts ? Epitre 4. ¹

Not only so, but 'tis probable he was deterred from an 3
undertaking above his years² by the. reason affigned by .

our English Boileau, When .
