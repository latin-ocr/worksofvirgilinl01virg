even in their transsations of them; and has chosen
to instance in Mr. Dryden’s transsation of Virgil's
AEneid‚ as he thought him one of our most cele-
brated poets. The mistakes are very numerous,
and some of them unaccountably gross. Upon this'
I was defirous to examine Mr. Pitt⁷s transsation of
the same paffageS, and was surprized to find, that
in near fifty instances, which Mr. Spence has given
of Mr. Dryden’s mistakes of that kind, Mr. Pitt
had not fallen into above three or four. A few
specimens may not be amisS‚ to enter-tain the cu-
riosity of their several readers.

ι. Cum tacet omnis ager. AEm 4. ver. 520,

And peace with downy wings was brooding on the ground·
Dryden, ver. 752. ¹

Vir-gil does not mention peace at all on this occa-
sion 3 and I do not remember, says Mr. Spence, to
have met with any one ancient representation of
Peace with wings. Pitt only says ε,

O’er all the fields a brooding silence reigns.
Pitt, ver. 759.

2. Jamque rubcfiebat radiis mare, et aethere ab alto
Aurora in rcseisfulgehat lutea bigis. AEn. 7. 26· .

Now when the rosy morn began to rise,

And wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the ikies.
Dryden, ver. 35.

MrsDryden here seems to have admitted some

mixture of the allegory and the reality together:‚ =
Virgil
