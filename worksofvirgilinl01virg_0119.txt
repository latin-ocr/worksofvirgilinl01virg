ECLOGUE THE SECOND.

ALEXIS‚

OUN G Corydon with hopeless love ador'd
, The fair Alexis, fav'rite of his lord-

Mid’ shades of thickest beech he pin’d alone,

To the wild woods and mountains made his mean,

Still day by day, in incoherent strains, 5
'Twas all he could, despairing told his pains.

- Wilt thou ne'er pity me, thou crue] youth,
Unmindful of my verse, my vows, and truth ?

still, clear Alexis, from my paffion fly ?

Unheard and unregarded must I die ? 14>
Now flocks in cooling shades avoid the heats‚

find the green lizard to his brake retr-eam,

'Now Thestylis the thyme and garlic pounds‚

And weary reapers leave the sultry grounds,

Thee still I follow o’er the burning plains 15
And join the ffirill Cicada’s plaintive strains.

Were it not better calmly to have borne

Proud Amaryllis' or Nlenalcas' scorn ἓ

Τὴο’ he was black‚ and thou art heav'nly fair?

How much you trust >that beauteous hue beware ἔ 20

trec, and fing all day long. Itis hence that this inse& is op-
.posed to the ant in the old AEsopian fables, which is asin-
dustrious and inoffeufive as the other is idle and troublesome.
virgil calls the Cicada querulae and raucae3 Martial, argutae
3 and inhumanae. Their note is the more troublesome‚ because
ξ in th'e great heats they fing alone. Any one who has paffed a
{summer in Italy, or in the south of France, will not think
' the epithet inhumanae too severe for them. SPENCE.
18. Amaryllis] Servius informs us, that the true name of
Amaryllis was Leria, a beautiful girl whom Maecenas gave to
virgil, as he also did Cebes, whom the poet mentions under
fhe person of Menalcas. Catrou thinks this story of Servius

¹³³. a fifflon5 but adds another fistion of his own, that Rome is
{neant by Amaryllis.
