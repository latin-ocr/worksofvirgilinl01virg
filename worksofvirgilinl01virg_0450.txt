Ι believe it is scarce poffible for a passage of equal

, length to contain more taste and judgment in it than

this : insomuch that there is hardly a fault, which a di·-
daffic poet can commit, that is not here hinted at.
omnim lived in the beginning of Commodus’s'‘
reign, and was afterwards greatly patronized by Severus.
He wrote two didaffie poems, one upon fifh-ing, called:
Halieutica 3 the other on hunting, entituled Cynegeticaff ·
The former is the most celebrated of the two. Rapin
tells us, he is a dry prosaic writer. But it is observable,
that this critic seldom speaks favourably of the Greek
authors z the reason of which may probably be, that like
many a modern critic he did not understand that lan-
guage ; and M. Menage affures us he did not. Scaliger,
a much abler ³¹* judge, says of Oppian, that he is an ex-
cellent poet3 easy, eloquent, sublime and harmonious ς
that he not only far surpasses Gratius and Nemesianus,
who have written on the same subjecS't, but that he feems'
to have the very air of Virgil, whom he endeavoured par-
ticularly to imitate; and that he has given us the truest'
and liveliest image of that divine poet. Though the
censures and praises of Scaliger are generally extravagant ς
and though in the present case, he seems to have bestowed*
his encomiums on Oppian a little too lavishly, yet I be-
lieve this writer is well worthy the learned reader’s per-
usal, for many of his descriptions (for instance one of a
horse and a battle of furious bulls) are well worked up ’

and extremely natural and lively.
