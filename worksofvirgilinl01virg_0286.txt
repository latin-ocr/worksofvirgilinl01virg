Laudibus Italiae certent : non Baetra, neque Indi,
Totaque turiferis Panchaia pinguis arenis.

Haec loca non tauri spirantes naribus ignem ¹²4⁸
Invenere, satis inmanis dentibus hydri3

Nec galeis, densisque virfim seges horruit hastis ε

Nec rapit inmensos orbis per humum, neque tanto
Squameus in spiram tra6³tu se conligit anguis.

Adde tot egregias urbis, operumque laborem, 155

supernatural property, imagining that it makes the cattle white

piness of Italy, Virgil mentions its having so many towns built
on craggy rocks and hills. There were more formerly, and are
several still. In the road foom Rome to Naples, you see no less
than four in one view, from the hill on which Piperno now Ι.
stands; reckoning that for one of them. These were very
usefu1‚ of old, for defenee, among such a fighting race of
people: and are so still for their coolness, in so hot a climate,
that they are generally forced to drive their fiocks of sheep up ·=
upon the mountains for the summer season, as they usually Γ

seed them in the fheltered plains by the sea-fide in the winter. Ῐ
