Book 4. Tm: GEORoxcs οι·- Vmon„ 347

Nor springing herbs let roving heifers crush,

Nor nibbling ssreep the morning dew-drops brussr,

Nor scaly lizards near their walls be found, ¹5
Nor ravenous birds, nor merops flit aronud,

Nor Progne, markt her breast with hands of blood ς

. Each wandering inse& they destroy for food,
¹ Arrest the lab’ring bees, a luscious prey,

And to th' expediant hungry nests convey. 20
But near, let fountains spring, and rivulets pass,
Meand'ring thro' the tufts of moss and grass 3
Let spreading palm before the portal grow,
Or olive wild his iheltering br'anches thr0w;
That when the youthful swarms come forth to play, 2 5
Beneath the ver‘nal sun’s unclouded ray,
The kings may lead them to this cool retrear,
Where flow'ry banks invite, and boughs defend from heat-
Hast thou a living rill, or stagnant lake?
With willows and huge stones the waters break ; 30
On which the wanderers safely may alight,
When rains or winds retard their destin’d flight;
On which emerging from the waves, may land,
And their wet wings to tepid suns expand.
Let caffia green and thyme shed sweetness round, 35
Savoury‚ and strongly-scented mint abound‚
Herbs that the ambient air with fragrance fill ;
While beds of violets drink the freshening rill.

Whether your hive you frame of woven boughs,
Or rear with pliant bark the concave house, 40
Strait be its entrance ; lest the varying year
Congeal the golden combs with frost severe,

fingers deep, with several {hells or small stones standing a little
above the sur-face of the water, that the bees may drink.

36. Savourjy] The thymbra of the ancients is generally
thought, says Dr. Martyn, to be some species of satureia, or
ἤνυσαν). Serpyllum is wild thyme. Caffia is not rosemary, as
Some have s upposed.
