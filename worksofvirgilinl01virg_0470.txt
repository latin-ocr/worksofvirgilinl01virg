From morn to eve3 unmindful of her form,
Unmindful of the happy dress that stole

The wishes of the youth, when every maid
With envy pin'd. Hence finally, by night
The village-matron, round the blazing hearth,
Suspends the infant-audience with her tales,
Breathing astonishment! of witching rhyme's,
And evil spirits of the death-bed call

To him who robb’d the widow and devour’d
The orphan's porti0n3 of unquiet souls

Ris'n from the grave to ease the heavy guilt
Of deeds in life conceal'd3 of ihapes that wall<

At dead of night, and clank their chains, and wave
The torch of hell about the murd'rer’s bed.

At ev'ry solemn pause the croud recoil

Gazing each other speechlcss‚ an'd congeal’d
With {hiv'ring fighs z till eager for th' event,
Around the beidame all ere& they hang,

Each trembling heart with grateful terrors qucll'd.

3. BEAUTY.

-——-—· Brightest progeny of heav'n 1
How shall I trace thy features? where sele&
The roseate hues to emulate thy bloom ?
Haste then, my song, thro' nature’s wide expanse‚
Haste then and gathes all her con-»eliest wealth,
Whate’er bright spoils the florid earth contains,
Whate'er the wama, or the liquid air,
To deck thy lovely labour. Wilt thou fly
With laughing Autumn to th' Atlantic isses
And range with him th’ Hesperian field and sca,
Where’er his fingers touch the fruitful grove,
The branches shoot with gold3 where’er his step
NIarks the glad soil, the tendet clusters glow
With puxple ripcncss, and invest each hill
