Book 2. THE Gssonoxcs οι·- Vmon„ 245

F ruits of 'tl-‚c richest juice in time decay,

And birds amid degenerate vineyards prey ;

All, all, must feel the force of toil intense, 75
Be to the trench confin’d, and tam’d with large expence.
With best success, from truncheons olives spring3
Layers of the vine the fairest clusters bring 3

From sets will bloom the myrde, plant of love 3

But quite full-grown transplant the hazle grove 3 80
Ash too, tho' tall, and that fair tree whose boughs

Bear the broad crown that binds Alcides’ brnws,

dicated‚ had a gai-den, we know, on the Esquiline hill, cele-
brated by Horace and others; and ’tis not improbable, that
in order to bring it sooner to perfectiori, this might be prac-
tis’d there, perhapsjust at the tirne when Virgil was writing
this Georgic. If so, how artfully does the poet here insinuate,
with his usual address, a compliment to his patron ? Ι only hint
this as a conjecture ; but am more inclin'd to believe, that
something of the wilderness part of a garden is intended, by
the palm being placed among the others 3 which, tho' a fruit-
tree in its own country, yet is not improperly put here in the
company of forest-trees, because it did not bear fruit, nor was
counted‘ a fruit-tree at that time in Italy 3 as Pliny informs us
lib. iii. c. 4. and therefore could be planted only, as the others
might, for beauty and ornament to gardens.

Whether virgil had any such view or not, there can, at least
be no doubt but that-removing tall trees was praetis'd among
the Romans. W'e find by Pliny, that the common method of
making their arbusta, or plantations for supporting vines, was
by planting out elms, when about five years old, or about
twenty foot high: lib. xvii. c. 11. And the fir, mention’d
above, which Pliny tells us had so deep a root, must certainly
have been a tall tree, and yet, he says, was removed. As to
the palm, tho' it did not arrive to such perfeetion in Italy, as to
bear fruit, yet we find it was common there 3 and a tree which
not only would bear rmnoving, but thrive the better for it.

And to put this matter about removing tall trees beyond dis-

ute, Vix-gil himself confirms it in another plac-e, and makes
Eis Corycius Senex put it in practice, Georg. iv. 144, Sec.

Ille etiam strar in versiam distulit ulmos,
Eduramque pirum, &spinos jam prunafi’rcntes‚
Jamque ministrantem platanum potantibus umbras.
