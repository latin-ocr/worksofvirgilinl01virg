ECLOGUE THE TENTH.

ARGUMENT.

Α The poet introduces his friend and patron Gallus, lying under
Ι a solitary rock in Arcadia, bewailing the incvgstancy of
his mi ress Lycoris, by whom is meant the beautiful Ci-
theris, a most celebrated aHress, that left him to follow
some qfficer into Germany. He describes the rural deities
coming to viſst Gallus in his dzstrcss, as they do Daphnis in
Theocritus, and last of all Apollo himself, who all endea-

war in vain to comfort him.
