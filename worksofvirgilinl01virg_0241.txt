Unless νᾶἰῒὴ annual industsy and art,
They cull’d each largest out, and plac’d apart: >
For such the changeful lot of things below, ι 235

¹As one, who 'gainst a strearn's impetuons course,
Scarce pulis his ssow boat, urg’d with all his force,
If once his vigour cease‚ or arms grew ssack,
Instant, with headlong haste, the torrent whirls him back.
We too as much must mark Arffzurus' signs, 241
WVhen rise the Kids‚ when the bright Dragon shines,
AS home-bound mariners, in‘ tempests rost,
Near Pontus, or Abydos’ oyster’d coast.
When Libra mensures out to day and night, 243
Equal proportions both of {hade and light3
Work, work your bullocks, barley sow, ye swains,
'Till winter’s first imprafficable rains-
Now in their beds, your poppies hide and flax 3
With frequent harrowings smooth the furrows' backs,
Now while ye may, while the dari< welkin low’rs, 251
O'er the dry glebe while clouds suspend their ihow'rs.

the farthest off. Thus if one was to say, in extremo pente, it
may mean the hither extremlty or end of the bridge3 and when
Virgil says his countrymen sslould work

Usque sub extremum brumae intratlabz'lis imbrem :

it must be understood of the beginning of that rainy season,

which was itself unfit for work; mis took up the iatter half of

December, which was therefore turned 211 into holy-days‚ or

the Saturnalia, in which the ssaves that were at other times
. kept hard to work, were· indulged in particular liberties‚ and
¹ ¹spent all the time in mirth and joviality. Honnswoarn.
