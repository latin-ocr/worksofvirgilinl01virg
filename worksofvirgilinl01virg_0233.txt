Ye husbandmen ! of righteous Heav’n intreat 120
A winter calm and dry 3 a solstice wet3 Ι
For winter-diust delights the pregnant plain,
The happiest covcring for the bury’d grain ;
Hence matchiess harvests Mysia boasting reaps,
And Gargarus admires his unexpeehed heaps. 125
thy should Ι tell of him, who, on his land
Fressi-sown, destroys each ridge of barren sand 3
Then instant, o’er the levell’d furrows brings
Refreshful waters from the cooling springs ;
, Behold, when burning suns, or Syrius’ beams 13&
Strike fiercely on the fields, and withering stems;
Down fro‘m the summit of the neighb’ring hills,
O'er the smooth stones he calls the bubbling rills;
Soon as he clears, whate'er their passage stay’d,
And marks their future current with his spade, 135
Before him scattering they prevent his pains, '
Burst all abroad, and drench the thirsty plains.
Or who, lest the weak stalks be over-weigh’d,
Feeds down, betimes, the rank luxuriant blade, }
’ When first it rises to the furrows' head. 140
Or why of him, who drains the marshy sands,
Colle& the moisture from th' absorbing sands‚
When bursting from his banks, th’ indignant flood
The country covers wide, with ssimy mud,
In doubtful months, when swellIng dykes resound 145
“ With torrents loud, and sweat and boil around.
. Yet after all 'these toils of swains and steers,
, Still rifing ills impend, and countless cares 3
The glutton goose, the Thracian cranes annoy,
Succory and noxious {hade thy crops destroy. 150

some bird, and very pernicious to the corn. They are still so
in flocks, in the Campania Felice, the country which Virgil
had chiefly in his eye when he wrote his Georgics.
