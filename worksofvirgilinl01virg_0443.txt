DIDACTIC POETRY. 407

stasons and employments‚ is too grave and fimple5 it
takes off from the surprize and variety of the poem, and
makes the whole look but like a modern almanack in
verse. The reader is carried through a course of weather,
and may beforehand guess, whether he is to meet with
snow or rain, clouds or sun-lhine, in the next descrip-
tion. The descriptions indeed have abundance of nature
in them ; but then it is nature in her fimplicity and un·-
dress. —— Nor has he shewn more of art or judgment in
the precepts he has given us, which are sown so very
thick, that they clog the poem too much, and are often
so minute and full of circumstances, that they weaken and
unnerve his verse. But after all, we are beholden to him
sor the first rough sketch of a Georgic‚ where we may
still discover something venerable in the antiqueness of the
work3 but if one would see the defign enlarged‚ the
figures reformed, and the colouring laid on, and the
whole piece finiihed, we must expe& it from a greater
master's hand.’'

I cannot help thinking, but that Mr. Addison hath
placed the merit of this venerable father of didafflc poetry
rather too low. There is a great beauty in his natural
and ¹artless way of writing; and such primaeval simpli-
city, tho’ it does not strike us at first sight so forcibly, as
a more laboured and artificia} style, yet is infinitely pleas-
ing to one of a just taste, and to any real lover of nature.
However Hefiod sometimes rises into great dignity of ex-
preffion, and has given many instances of true poetry.
Of this kind is his account of the iron age, where the
goodness of his heart appears in every line3 and which
concludes with the following admirable verses, describing·
with a lofty prosopopoeia, ΕΝνΥ, like a constant com-
panion following all the sons of men, and Moonsw and
NEMESIS, retreating from the earth.
