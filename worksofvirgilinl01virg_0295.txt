Book 2. THE Gnonmcs oF VIRGIL. 261.

But o'er the pit replenish'd, if the ground 295
Still rise, and in superfluous heaps abound,
O’er the thick glebe let sturdy bullocks toil‚
Cleave the compa&ed clods and ssuggiss] soil.
But earth that’s bitter‚ or with salt imbu’d,
Too wild for culture, for the plough too rude, 300
VVhere apples boast no more their purple hues,
And drooping Bacchus yiclds degen'rate juice,
May thus be known : Of twigs a basket twine
Like that from whence is strain’d the recent wine ;
This with the soil and crystal water fill, 305
Then squeeze the mass, while thro’ the twigs distil }
The big round drops in many a trickling rlll ς
Soon shall its nature from its taste appear,
And the wry mouth the bitter juice declare.
We learn from hence a fat and viscid land ; 310
It sticks like pitch uncrumbled to the hand ;
The moister mold a rank luxuriance feeds,
Of lengthen'd grass, and tall promiscuous wecd53
O may be mine no over-fertile plain,
That shoots too strongly forth its early grain ! 315
The light and heavy in the balance try,
The black and other colours strike the eye 3
Not so the cold3 10 ! there dark ivy spreads,
Or yews on pitch—trees lift their gloomy heads.
These rules observ'd‚ expose the clods to dry, 320
Bak’d and c0nc05³ccd by the northern {ky-
Trench deep, and turn the soil, before ye place
The tendet vines, a joy-diffufing race;
Fat molds grow mellow by the delver’s paim,
By fanning winds and frosts, and cooling ruins. 325

from the single circumstance, of a vulgar idea being quite con-
cealed in any dead language.
