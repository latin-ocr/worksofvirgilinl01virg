Book 4. Tm: GEORG1cs οι·- Vmorz. 361

Some turn the weighty mass with griping tongs,

While others heave the puffing bellows' lungs‚

Or the red bars in hifling water lave, 210
Deep Aetna groans below, thro' many an echoing cave‘g
No less (small things with greater to compare)
Toil the Cecropian bees with ceaseless care3

Each knows his task : the old their tow‘ns attend,

Shape their nice cells, their daedal works defend 3 215
But late at evening those of youthful prime

Return fatigu’d‚ their thighs surcharg'd with thyme3
They prey on arbutes, willow buds devour,

Sweet cama, and the saffron’s glowing flow'r 3

From fruitful limes fip rich mellifluous dew, 220
And suck soft hyacinths of purple hue.

ΑΗ rest together, all together toil :

At morn they rusti abroad‚ the flow'rs to spoil 3

When twilight evening warms thern to their home,
With weary wings and heavy thighs they come, 225
And crowd about the gate‚ and mix a drowsy hum.

At last, into their inmost chambers creep,

And silent lie dissolv'd in balmy sseep.

WVhen Eurus blows, or gathering winds impend‚

The skies they trust not, nor their ssights extend 3 230
’ But drink of streams that flow their city nigh„

Work near the walls, and short excurfions try 3

Poize their light bodies like a ballanc'd boat,

With sands, as through tempestuous air they float.

But chief, this circumstance may wonder move, 235
That none indulge th' enfeebling joys of love, '
None pangs of child-birth feel, but leaves among,
.-And fragrant flow'rs, they gather all their young3

Turba ministra, tamen pennas limina tensas

Explicat, obducens saetae quast vela parenti,

Virginibus tantum pudor atque modestia cordi est.
