Book 3. THE Gronoxcs 01.- Vinea. 313

Where strays thro' Pisa’s plain th’ Alphaean flood,
Or whirl along the Thunderer’s olive wood ;
To trumpets ssuill, to many a martial deed, 245
And glare of glittering arms inure the steed :
Oft let him toil the ssow car’s load to bear,
The rustling reins oft rattle in his ear :
With flattery sooth him, while with conscious pride, Ἴ
He feels his master clap his founding fide. 250
Regin betimes 3 while weak and youthful yet,
Bend his soft mouth to brook a ssender bit3
Just wean'd and trembling from his mother’s fide3
New to the curb, and in the course untry'd.
But when to four full springs his years advance‚ ’ 255
=Teach him to run the ring, with pride to prance 3
a The plain in measur’d steps and time to b'eat, .
And in alternate paces shift his feet ;
Ost let him seem to spring with labour‘d might;
Then challenge whirlwinds in his airy ssight : ⁷ 260
While as he pours abroad with loofen’d reins,
His lightsorne feet scarce touch the printless plains.
Like Boreas in his course, when rufhing forth
He calms the Scythian skies, and clears the cloudy north ε
Resound the tall tops of the trembling trees, 265
The heavy harvests nod beneath the breeze :
O’er plains, o'er seas, the driving tempest sweeps,
ᾖ And to the founding {hore pursues the boiling deeps.
ἱ A steed like this, with conquering steps will strain, ·
ἱ And foam with blood across th’ Elean piain3 ²70}
Ι Or with obedient neck the Belgic car sustain.
i When now the colt is broke to bear command,
Feed him with kindly care, and plenteous hand :
For yet untam’d‚ his pamper'd pride disdains
To feel the founding lasti, and galling teins. 275
