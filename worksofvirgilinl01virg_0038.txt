8 ‘THE L‘IFE OF VIRGIL0

Caesar in the forum, carried about his statue in solemn
procession with ono of Venus in the Circenfian gamos,
decreed suppiications to him on the news of'any vifi'cory,
and ordered he should be worshipped as a god. In allu-
sion to the death and deification of Caesar, virgi} com-
posed the fifth Eclogue. He introduces two {hepherds la-.
menting the death of Daphnis, a Sicilian1hepherd3 he
represents the catt'oe abstaining from their food for grief,
the very wild beasts lamenting, the fields withering, Apollo
and Pales leaving the plains, the nymphs mourning around
his body, and Venus herself bitterly lamenting2 ⁴

Atque deos atque astra vocat crudelia mater.

For Venus is undoubtedly the Mother here mentioned,
‘and not tho city of Rome, as Ruaeus imagines.

This opinion may bo confirmed by a parallel paffage in
the Metamorphoses. Ovid there represents Venus te1·ri-.

1 cannot forbear observing the pequiar beauty of the
epithet mifirabz‘le in Virgil This single word points
out the mangied body of Julius Caesar in almost as lively
a manner as Antony’s artful speech in Shakespear3
