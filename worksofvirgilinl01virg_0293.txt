Book 2. THE GnoRcoes or Vmcn„ 259

’ Banish’d their bow’rs, abroad they mount in air, 265
'While {hines the recent glebe ben eath the share.
For the lean gravel of the ssoping field,
And mould’ring stones, where snakes their manfions build,
Where in dark windings filthy reptiles breed,
¹And find sweet food their lurking young to feed 3 270
To bees ungenial‚ scarcely will supply
Their casia-flow’rs, and dewy rosemary.

At will, a stear'ning mist emsts, or drinks;
Which blooms with native grass for ever fair, 275

And floods of luscious oil thy olives give ;
This, with due culture, thou shalt surely find
Obedient to thy plough, and to thy cattle kind. 280
Such fertile lande rich Capua’s peasants till,
And such the soil beneath Vesevus' hill ;
And that, where o'er Acerrae’s prostrate tow’rs
Clanius his swelling tide too fiercely pours.

Then dig the solid eart'n3 and fink a pit3 ⁴ 200
Next, to its bed th' ejeffted soil restore,
And press with trampling feet the sufface o'er 3
If the meld fail, 'tis light ·‚ that soil inclines
Ι To fatten herds, and swell thy cluster'd vines.

- which is told with great dignity in the Latin, read⁸ gracefmly
and agreeably in a transsation, particularly the animated ex—
fipreffions, negabunt ire loca, et superabit terra.
