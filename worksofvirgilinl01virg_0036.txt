ὀ ΤΗΕΙΙΙΙΡΕ OF VIRGIL.

verses as may touch or affe& Cytheris (represented by
Lycoris) but such as may be fit for a person of a mar-
vellous sweetness of voice to pronounce. Let us hear
Catrou’s opinion with regard to this fixth Eclogue. It is
not from this verse

Prima Syracosio dignata cst ludere vast-2,

that I conjecture that this Eclogue ought to precede that
of Tityrus. It is for another reason, that I am going to Ἰ
produce. It is true, that the author of the life of Virgil
seems here to contradi& himself. He affirms, in one
place, that the Tityrus was the first Eclogue which the
Poet composed. “ It appears, says he, that Virgil had

He adds besides, that the Poet spent three years in com-
pofing his Bucolics, Bucolica triennio perfecit. That is,
if one can believe it, that Virgil began his first Eclogue
about the year of Rome 713, and finisned the last after the
year 715. . The same author also relates, that the Silenus
was recited by Cytheris, before a full audience, in the
presence of Cicero. This last sa& cannot poffibly be
true, suppoiing the Tityrus was Virgil's first performance
in this kind. Cicero was dead when our Poet composed
the Tityrus. In so manifest a contradiction, I incline to
the side of the story of Cytheris, which is attested by
Servius. As for the conjetsture formed by the writer of
Virgil’s life, that the Tityrus was his first Eclogue‚ it
is grounded upon a very frivolous argument. The quo-
tation from the fourth Georgic‚ which is the only sup-
port of it, proves only, that virgil, in the edition of,
his Bucolics‚ had placed the Tityrus in the front. It is
