Book 2. THE Gronoxcs οι·- VIRGIL. 255

Her spacious lakes3 first mighty Larius, thee? 200

And thee, Benacus, roaring like a sea?

Her ports and harbours‚ and the Lucrine mounds,

From which ,the beating main indignant bounds 3

Where Julius' flood of bonds impatient raves,

And calm Avernus’ streights confine the Tuscan waves ?

Her fields with brass and filver veins have glow'd, 206

Her pregnant rocks with gold abundant flow’d.

She birth to many a race, in battle brave,

The Marfian, and the Sabine soldier, gave.

Her’s are Liguria's sons, untaught to yield, 210

And her’s the-Volsci, ss<ill’d the spear to wield ;

The Decian hence, and Marian heroes came,

Hence sprung thy line, Camillus, mighty name :

Hence rose the Scipios‚ undisrnay'd in sight,

And thou, great Caesar, whose vif’torious might, 215

From Rome’s high walls, on Afia’s utmost plains,

Aw'd into peace fierce India's tage restrains.

All hail, Saturnian soil ἔ hail, parent great

Of fruits and mighty men! my lays repeat

For thee this argument of ancient art, 220

These useful toils, rever’d of old, impart3

For thee, I dare unlock the sacred spring,

And thro' the Roman streets Ascrean numbers fing.
Next, of each various soil the genius hear !

Its colour, strength, what best dispos’d to bear. 225

· Th' unfriendly cliffs, and unprolific ground,

Where clay jejune, and the cold flint abound,
Where bushes overspread the stubborn field,
Will best th' unfading grove of Pallas yield :

passage is worth the reader‘s perusal.
