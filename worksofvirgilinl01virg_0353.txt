’ Loud 0’er the rocks then rolls with horrid roar,
And mountain-like bursts on the subje& ssxore ε
The troubled depths in circling eddies rise,
And heave the sable sand in whirlwinds to the {kies-
Thus man and beast, the tehants of the flood, 310
The herds that graze the plain, the feathery brood,
Rufi) into love, and feel the general flame 3
For love is lord of all, and is in all the same.

’Tis with this rago the mother lion stung, “
Prowls o’er th'e plain, regardless of her young. 315
’Tis then the sslapeless bear with scenes of blood,
With murderous deeds pollutos th' affrighted wood z
Then boars in fight with double warmth engage,
y And the grim tygress calls forth all her rage-
ἶ, Ah Ι wretched then the traveller who strays 320
ἵ ’ F orlorn o’er Libya's unfrequented ways!
ἶ See, what thick pants the stallion’s fires declare,
Whene’er in tainted gales he scents the mare :
Nor curbs, nor torturing whips his tage restrain‚
And mountains rise to check his flight in vain; 325
In vain the torrent rolls, that tumbling sweeps
The maffy fragment from the craggy steepS.

Ruffies the Sabine boar, and rends the ground,
And whets his tusks to strike the furer wound :

Rubs his rough fides against th’ accustom’d oak, 330
And disciplines his brawn to bear the rival's stroke.

How fares the youth, who feels the pleafing pain

His marrow pieree, and throb in every vein? }
In darkness drear he swims the stormy main :

’ Above from heaven's high gate the thunder roars, 335
*The daffiing waves re·echo round the shores.

Nor weeping parents, nor the fated fair

Retards.his course, too soon his cruel death to share !
Why should I fing how hungry wolves engage,

How beasts of Bacchae car, how mastiffs rage ? 340
