Book 4. Tm: Gssokcrcs oF Vmou. 379'

T han whom no river, thro’ such level meads

Down to the sea with swifter torrents speeds. 440
Now to the vaulted chamber was he come,

Where hanging pumice form’d an aweful dome;

When fond Cyrene ask’d him of his woe,

And whence those bitter tears began to flow-

The fisters‚ water from the purest spring, . 445
And towels soft, with haste officious bring3

Prepare full bowls, and heap up choicest meats 3

The altars blaze with rich Arabian sweets.

Of Lydian wine, she cry’d, these goblets take,

To Ocean let us due libations make 3 ’ 450
At once to Oeean old, in ritual layS,

Parent os all things, she devoutly prays;

And to the sister nymphs‚· whose gentle sway

An hundred groveS, an hundred streams obey5

Thrice o'er the fire the liquid neEtar thrOWS‚ 455
Thrice to the shining roos the flames arose.

She thus, with that auspicious omen fir’d;

In the Carpathian gulf there dwells retir'd

The prophet Proteus 3 o’er the wat’ry way,

Whose car the finny, two-legg’d steeds convey : 460
Now to his distant country he resorts‚

Emathia seeking, and Pal'iene’s ports;

The sea-nymphs this caerulean seer adore,

And him reveres ev’n hallow’d Nereus hoar;

All things he knows, tbo' hid in time’s dark womb‚ 465
What is, what long ispast, and what shall come;

So Neptune wi11²d 3 whose monstrous herds he keeps,
Of squalid calves‚ beneath the rolling deeps.

Him must thou chain, and force him to disclose

The cause and cure of thy distraEting woes. 470
Nought he'll unfold‚ except the god thou bind,

Nor prayers‚ nor tears can move his stedfast mind‚
With force and chains, my son, his limbs surround‚
Thefe can alone his treach’rous wiles confound.
