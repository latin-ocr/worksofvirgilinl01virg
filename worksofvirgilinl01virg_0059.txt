THE LIFE OF VIRGIL. 29·

former excell'ed all mankind in JUDGMENT, and the latter
in ῙΝνΕΝτῙοῑι. Methinks the two Poets (says ΜΓ. Pope)
resemble the heroes they celebrate 3 Homer, boundless and
irrefistible as Achilles, bears all before him, and ss1ines
more and more, as the tumult increases : Virgil‚ calmly
daring like AEncaS, appears undisturbed in the midst of
the afflon, disposes all about him, and conquers with
tranquillity. Or when we look on their machines,
Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrorS, ssiaking
Olympus, scattering the lightnings‚ and firing the hea-
vens: Virgil like the same Power in his benevolence,
counselling with the gods, laying plans for empires, and
regularly ordering his whole creation-

. By way of conclufion to this life, I will add some
beautiful verses, which I wonder to find omitted in all
our late editions 3 as their purity and simple elegance
may justly induce one to suppose they came from the hand
of Virgil.

DEDICATIO AENEIDos.

AD VENEREM.

Si mihi susceptum fuerit decurrere munus,
O Venus, O sedes quae colis Idalias !
Troius AEneas Romana per oppida digno
Jam tandem ut tecum carmine velius eat 3
IVon ego thure modo aut pasta* tua templa tabelld
ornabo, & puris sertaferam manibu53
Corniger hos aries humiles 53⁷ maxima taurus
VieJima sacrato tinget odore focos 3
ll‘Iarmoreusque tibi divetficoloribus alis
Interior p'ieJa stabit amor pharetra 3
Αιζβε, O Cytherea! tuus te Caesar olympo,
Et Surrentini littoris gra vocat.

P. VIRGILH
