324 P. VIRGILH MARoms Gi-:oRmcan Lib. 3.

Non secus -ac patriis acer Romanus in armis 346
Injusto sub fasce viam cum carpit, et hosti

Ante exspecstatum positis stat in agmine castris.

At non, qua Scythiae gentes, Maeotiaque unda,
Turbidus ac torquens flaventis Hister arenas, 35⁶
Qxaque red-it medium Rhodope porretff'ta sub axem,

Illic. clausa tenent stabulis armenta, neque ullae

Aut herbae campo adparent, aut arbore frondes:

Sed jacet aggeribus niveis informis, et alto

Terra gelu late, septemque adsurgit in ulnas. 355
Semper hiems, semper spirantes frigora Cauri.

Tum sol pallentis haud umquam discutit umbras :

Nec cum inveems equis altum petit aethera z nec cum
Praecipitem Oceani rubro lavit aequore currum.
Concrescunt subitae currenti in flumine crustae, 360
Undaque jam tergo ferratos sustinet orbis,

Puppibus illa prius patulis, nunc hospita plaustris-
Acraque diffiliunt volgo, vestesque rIgescunt

Indutae, caeduntque securibus humida vina,

Et totae solidam in glaciem vertere lacunae, 363
Stiriaque inpexis induruit horrida barbis.

but likewise provisions for a fortnight, and stakes and utenfils.

433. Notso.] The contrast is very strong between the scenes
of Africa and Scythia, and has a fine effeti. This‘variety‚ this

magic art of conveying the reader fro-m one climate to another, ⁴³2²?

constitutes one of the greatest beauties of poetry.‘

M. de Maupertuis, who, with. some other academicians, was
sent by the king of France, in 1736, to measure a degree of
sthe meridiam under the arftic circle, says, that brandy was
the only liq'uor, which could be kept sufficiently fluid for them
· to drink ε Pendanl unfrdid stgrmm', que la langue et les levressej
geloient sur le champ, contre le taffb, &aa And a little afterwards
he tells us, that the spirits of wine froze in their thermorneters.

 

442. Nor thesim's ruys] ln the original this is a verse con- .

sisting wholly of ssow spondees, which by their melancholy

flow represent the dismalness of the object described.
443. W‘henfirst he climbs.] This winter-piece has ever been
adnmed as ene of the capital paintings of virgil. Thomson
