With dusky redness veil'd his chearful light,

. And impious mortals fear’d eternal night:

Then too, the trembling earth, and seas ‘that rag'd, 545
And dogs‚' and boding birds dire ills presag'd ε

What globes of flames hath thund’ring Aetna thrown,
What heaps of sulphur mix’d With molten stone,

From her burst entrails did she oft exspire,

And deluge the Cyclopean fields with fire ἕ 550

latter at Philippi near the confines of Thrace. And though
historians (all except Lucius Florus) for distinfflmvs sake, call
the latter battle only by the name of Pnilippi; yet. as there
was one at Philippi near Pharsalia, in fight of which the former
