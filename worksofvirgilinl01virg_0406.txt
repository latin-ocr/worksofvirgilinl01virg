Omnis in hac certam regio jacit arte salutem.

Exiguus primum, atque ipsos contraE’ms ad usus 295
Eligitur locus. hunc angustique imbrice teeti
parietibusque premunt artis, et quatuor addunt,
Qxatuor a ventis obliqua luce fenestras.

Tum vitulus, bima curvans jam cornua fronte,
Quaeritur: huic geminae nares, et spiritus oris 300
Multa reluetanti obstruitur, plagisque peremto

Tunsa per integram solvuntur viscera pellem.

Sic positum in clauso linquunt, et ramea costis

protector of Egypt. The fields were delivered up to it; but
the cities that were raised with immense labour, and stood like
issands in the midst of the waters‚ look down with joy on the
plains which were overflowed, and at the same time enriched
by the Nile.

This is a general idea of the nature and effefits of this river,
so famous among the ancients. ,

There cannot be a finer sight than it affords at two seasons of
the year. Foris a man ascends some mountain, or one of the
lar-gest pyramids of Grand Caim, in the months of July and
August, he beholds a vast sea, in which numberless towns and

villeges appear, with several causeys leading from placle to ‘
