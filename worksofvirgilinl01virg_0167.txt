ECLOGUE THE SIX'TH.

SILENUS.

On the Epicurean Philosophy natural and moral.

Y Muse first sported in Sicilian strains,

Nor bluih'd to dwell amid' the woods and plains ς
'When chiefs and fields of fight to fing I try'd,
Apollo whisp'ring check’d my youthful pride ;
Go, Tit’rus‚ gc, thy flocks and fatlings seed, „⁵
To humbler subjasts suit thy rustic reed5
Thus warn’d‚ O Varus, in heroic lays,
’ While bards sublime resound thy martial praise,
I meditate the rural minstrelsy 3
Apollo bids, and I will sing of thee. 10
Pleas’d with the subje&, with indulgent eyes
If any read, and this, ev’n this ssiould prize‚
Thy name shall echo thro' each hill and grove,
And Phoebus' sels the votive strains approve 3
No page so much delights the god of verse, 15
As where the lines great Varus' praise rehearse.

Stretch'd in a cavern on the mossy ground,

Two sportive youths Silenus sseeping found,
With copious wine o'ercome3 his fiowery wreath
,Just from his temples fall’n, lay strewn beneath3 20
His maffy goblet drain’d of potent juice
Was hanging by, worn thin with age and use3
They bind him fast (tho’ cautious and afraid)
With manacles of his own garlands made3
For oft the senior had deceiv'd the swains 25
With hopes (for well he sung) of pleasing strains:
Young Aegle too to join the frolic came, ’
The loveliest Naid of the neighb'ring stream 3
