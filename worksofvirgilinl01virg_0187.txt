ECLOGUE THE EIGHTH.

PHARMACEUTRIA.

DAMON and ALPHESIBOEUS.

Harm’d with the songss of two contending swains‚
The herds for wonder ceas’d to graze the plains,
In deep surprise the lynxes listening st00d‚‘
The rolling rivers stopt their headlong flood l
O Pollio l leading thy vicstorious hands, γ 3
O'er deep Timavus' ος Illyria's sands ; ”
O When ,thy glorious deeds ffiall I rehearse,
When tell the world how matchless is thy verse,
Worthy the lofty stage of laurell’d Greece,
Great rival of majestic Sophocles ! 10
With thee began my songs, with thee {hall end ;
The strains thyself commanded, O attend Ι
And ’mid the laurels which thy brows entwine,
Admit this hurnble ivy-wreath of mine.
Night‚ her unwholesome {hadows scarce withdrew, 15
What time the cattle love the cooling dew,
Damon, against an olive's trunk reclin'd‚

· Thus pour'd the transports of his jealous mind.

DAMON.
Bright Lucifer arise ! bring on the day,
While I deceiv'd by Nisa pine away, 270

To heav'n addreffing my last pray'rs and tears,
Yet which of all the gods my sorrow hears ?

Begin with me, my pipe, Maenalian strains.
Delightful Maenalus, ’mid echoing groves,
And vocal pines, still hears the ssiepherds’ loves 3 25
The rural warblings hears of skilful Pan,
Who first to tune negle&ed reeds began.

Begin, &c-
