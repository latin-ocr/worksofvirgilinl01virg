Theophrastus, from whom Virgil borrowed largely in his ac-·
count of bees. They affert and prove that no animal (nay no.
plant) is produced without a concurrence of the two sexes, and
that consequently equivocal generation is an idle and most

groundless opinion„ See Redi de z'nstdis, and the wffls of “

Linnaeus. With regard to the generation of bees, Ι {hall pre—⁴
sent the reader with a large but entertaining extra& from a
French author lately published. The matter of the treatise is
taken from the works of the learned Mr. Max-aldi, and ΜΓ.
de R’eaumur‚ and is flung into a sprightly dialogus.

It begins with a general view of the hive. The glass hive
represents a city of fixteen or eighteen thousand inhabitants-
This city is a monarchy,⁴¹ confisting of a queen, of grandees,
soldiers, artizans‚ porters, houses, streets, gates, magazines,

and a most stri& civil policy, The queen dwells in a palace in* ,

the inner part of the city; some of the cells (which run per,-
pendicular from the top of the hive) are larger than the rest,

and belong to those, who afterthe queen, hold the first rank

in the commonwealth; the others are inhabited by the corn-
mon people. The cells are all publick buildings, which bea
long to the society in common 3 for among this people there is ”
no meum nor tuum. Some cells are close magazines for a store
of honey3 others for the daily nourishment of the labouring
bees3 others are destin’d to receive eggS‚ and to lodge the
worm from which the young bee springs.

In the hive there is usually but one queen, fix or eight hun,
dred, or even a thousand males called drones, and from fif-

teen to fixteen thousand, or upwards, of bees without sex, who
carry on the whole policy and manufactum of the hive. The Δ

mother—hee, or the queen-mother,- is the soul of the commu-⁷
nity, and but for her, every thing would languish ; when she
is secreted from the hive, the other bees lose all care of pos-
terity‚ and make neither honey nor wax, so that the city soon
becomes desolate and empty.——The rest of the bees pay her
the most dutiful respect, and follow her wherever lhe goes, or
is carried from home. Her subjefts perform their several func-
tions without any instruCtions, and without giving her the least
trouble. Her only bufiness is to people the hive; and this she -
fulfils so perfeffly, as well to deserve the most honourable of -
all politica] titles, that of Parent cf her country. To rnerit the
love of her subjedk, 'tis necessary she should produce from ten
to twelve thousand children in the space of seven weeks, and
one year with another, fro‘m thirty to forty thousand. She is
easily distinguifh’d from the other bees, by the form of her
body, which is longer and ssenderer. ,ῌεζ wings aresslhvstffib
