Ecl. 8. Tm: Enoc-‚uns 01⁴· Vmon.. 165

Ev'n thus, may disregarded Daphnis burn,
Pine to despair, nor I his flame return ἕ
Bring, &c.
This vest the faithless traitor left behind,
Pledge of his love Ι give, to thee confign'd, 120
O sacred earth ! thus plac'd beneath the door,
O may the precious pledge its lord restore !
Bring, &c-

’ These powerful‚ poisonous plants in Pontus dug,

(Pontus abounds in many a magic drug) 125
Sage Moeris gave5 in dire enchantments brew’d,
R'Ioeris his limbs with these has oft 'bedew’d.
Hence the fell sorcerer have I seen become
A wolf, and thro' wild forests howling roam,
With these from graves the starting spefires warn, 130
And whirl to distant fields the standing corn.
Bring, &a
Take now these ashes from th' expiring wood,
And strew them, Amaryllis, o'er the flood ;
But backward cast them, dare not look behind, 135
With these I’ll strive to touch his harden'd mind 3
But weak all art my Daphnis' breast to move,
For he nor charms regards, nor pow'rs above.
Bring‚ &c.
Lo ἔ round the altar’s fides what flames aspire ! 140
The dying embers burst into a fire !
List I Hylax bai-ks ! O may it lucky prove !
But ah ! how oft are we deceiv'd that love ?
Can it be truth ? my heart will Daphnis ease ?
He comes, my Daphnis comes—Enchantments cease ἒ
