Book 4. Tm: Gnonmcs 01·- Vmon„ 365

On rugged rocks, oft as ahroad they fly

They tear their Wings7 sni< with their ioads and die5
Such love of flow’rs infiat-nes their 330:st henas,

So great their glory in these maechicss arcs„

Tho’ seven short years are to one race decret& 245
Stil} they continue an exhaustless breed, }
From age to age increase, and sires to fires succeed-
Lydiam, nor Medes‚ so much their king adore,

Nor those on Nilus' or Hydaspes' fluore t

The state united stands, while he remains, 250
But should he fall, what dire confusion reigns ἔ

Their waxen comb3‚ and honey late their joy,

With grief and fage distra&ed‚ they destroy z

He guards the works‚ with awe they him surround,

‚And crowd about him with triumphant found ς 2 55¹
Him frequent on their duteous shoulders bear,

Bleed‚ fall, and die for him in glorious war.

'Led by such wonders‚ fages have opin'd,

That bees have portions of an heavenly mind:

That God pervades‚ and like one common foul, 260,
Pius, feeds, and animates the world's great whole3
That flocks, herds‚ beasts, and men from him receive
Their vital breath‚ in him all move and live3

That souls discerpt from him [hall never die,

But back resolv'd to God and heaven ffiass fly, 265}
And live for ever in the starry sky.

When of its sweets the dome thou would'st deprive‚
Diffuse vuarm-spirted water thro' the hive, }
Or noxious smoke thro' all their dwellings drive.

Twice the sweet artists plenteous honey make, 270
Thou twice each year th' amhrofial treasures take 3

‚First when Taygete shews her beauteous head,
Disdaining Ocean’s melancholy bed;

'Tis pmbable, that on the ancient globes this was a distin&
constellation from Taurus, and represented by one of the
fisters only, that named by virgil. Aratus and Eratosthenes
both speak of it as ‘distinet from Taurus3 and the latter calls it
