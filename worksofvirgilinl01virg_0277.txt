Haste then, my better part of fame, my pride,
Do thou my course at once affist and guide; 50
Do thou, Maecenas, share with me the gale,
And o'er expanded seas unfurl the swelling sail-
Nor soars my thought ambitious to rehearse
All nature's wonders, in my shorter verse3
A talk like this, would ask an hundred tongues, 55
An hundred mouths, and iton-armed lungs.
Still will we keep the friendly ffiore at hand,
Nor dare to launch too boldly from the land :
Nor will I tire thine ear with fables vain,
With long preambles and superfluous strain. 60
The trees, whose ffiades spontaneous pierce the fines,
Tho’ barren, beautiful and vig'rous rise3
For nature works beneath : but if thy toil
Graft‚ or transplant them in a gentler soil,
Their genius wild‚ where-e'er thou lead'st the way, 6 5
Of discipline sequaceous‚ will obey :
So will the sprouts that from the roots arose,
’ If plac’damid the plain, in order'd rows ε
For else the mother's oversnadowing top,
Or blasts the fruit, or checks the promis'd crop. 70
All trees from seed advance by ssow degrees,
And for a future race their shades increase ς

Here the poet makes a graceful figure, whilst he shews his gra-
titude by owning his obligations, and at the same time that he
makes his court to his patron, he makes his patron's court to
his prince. ΕΕΝεοΝ.

59. Fables valn.] He points at the truth, and the dignity,
and the utility of his subjeft, exalting it above subjefilzs of mere
fifflon, and Grecian tales.

61. The trees.] The poet had before mentioned the three
ways by which wild trees are produced.-Here he follows the

same meth0d‚ and shews by what culture each sort may be
meliorated. · MA R τ Y N .
