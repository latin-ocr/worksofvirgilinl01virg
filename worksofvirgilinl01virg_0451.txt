DIDACTIC POETRY. μς

Thus much may suffice for the Greek dida&ic poets ε as
Nicander, who flouristied in the 158th olympiad, is but a
flat and prosaic writer, in his Theriaca, though copied
by Virgil.

 

 

Major rerum mihi nascitur ordo0

For Ι am next to speak of LucRETms, whose merit as
a poet has never yet been sufficiently displayed, and who
seems to have had more fire, spirit, and energy‚ more of
the vivida vis animi, than any of the Roman poets, not
excepting Virgil himself. Whoever imagines, with
Tully, that Lucretius had not a great genius, is defired
to cast his eye on two pietures he has given us at the
beginning of his poem, the first of Venus with her
lover ’ἓ Mars, beautiful to the last degree, and more

glowing than any figure painted by Titian ;' the † second ,

of the terrible and gigantic figure, the daemon of Super-
stition, worthy the energetic pencil of NIichael Angelo.
Neither do I think that the description that immediately
follows of the sacrifice of Iphigenia, was excelled by the
famous picture of Timanthes on the same subjec‘t, of
which Pliny speaks so highly in the 35th book of his
Natural History ε especially the minute and moving cir-
cumstances of her perceiving the grief of her father Aga-
memnon, and of the priest's concealing his sacrificing

knife,
