The finny race exulting round him play,
And in wild gambols dassi the bitter spray3
The scaly phocae, sunk in sseep profound, 510
. Along the shore their guardian god surround ;
He (like a peasant skill’d the herds to keep,
When evening homeward warns the calves and sheep,
When hungry wolves, with pleasure listening‚ hear,
And mark for prey, the lambs that bleat from far) 515
With watchful eyes, high-seated on a rock,
Reviews and counts the numbers of his flock.
The lucky youth with this occasion blest,
Just as the seer compos'd his limbs to rest,
Russ1’d onhim with a mighty threatening found, 520
And fast, the weary‚ ssumbering senior bound.
He, every various art diffembling tries,
And many a monster's direful ihape belies;
Roars horrid like a prowling savage, glows
Like crackling fite, or like a river flows 3 525
But when no fraud could further his escape,
He spoke, return'd to human voice and {hape :
Rash youth ! who bade thee to my court repair
With impious boldness ? what thou seek'st, declare l
Ο Proteus! well thou know'st the cause, he cry’d, 530
Nought from thy piercing eyes, can mortass hide 3
Obedient to the Gods, I seek to know
What fate decrees, and how to h‘eal my woe.
The prophet, while his bosom boil’d with ire,
And while his green eyes {hot indignant fire, 5 35¹
Gnashing his teeth, with fury in his look,
Compell’d, at length, the fates disclofing, spoke;
Thou suffer'st for atrocious crimes 3 on thee
F alls the just vengeance of a deity 3
Unhappy Orpheus on thy guilt hath sent, 540
And more dost thou deserve, this punishment ς
And more ssialt feel, unless by fate deny’d,
For still he rages for his murder'd bride. V
