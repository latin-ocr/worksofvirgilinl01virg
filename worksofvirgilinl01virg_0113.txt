Ecl. ι.. THE Eczomms or Vmorz. 83

While from steep rocks the pruner's song is heard 3
Nor the soft-cooing dove, thy fav'rite bird,
Mean while fflall cease to breathe her melting strain,
Nor turtles from th’ a'e‘rial elm to plain.
TITYRUS.
Sooner the stag in fields of air shall feed, 75
Seas leave on naked shores the scaly breed,
The Parthian and the German climates change,
This Arar drink, and that near Tigris range,
Than e'er, by stealing time effac’d‚ shall part

His much-lov'd image from my grateful heart. 80
MELIBOEUS. *X
But we far hence to distant elimes {hall go,- x

O'er Afric’s burning sands, or Scythia's snow‚

Where roars Oaxis, or where scas embrace,

Dividing from the world, the British race.

Ah ! shall I never once again behold, 85
When many a year in tedious round has ross'd,

My native seats ?--Ah ! ne’er with raviiht thought
Gaze on my little realm, and turs-built cot?

· What! must these rising crops barbarians share?

These well-till'd fields become the spoils of war? 90
See to what mis'ry discord drives the swain!

See, for what lords we spread the teeming grain l

Now Meliboeus, now, renew your cares,

Go, rank again your vines, and graft your pears:
Away‚ my goats‚ once happy floeks ! away! 95
No more shall I resume the rural lay :

measure the years by the harvests. Arista is the beard of the
wheat; the Roman husbandmen sowed only‘the bearded wheat.

·87. Ah .' neh-tn] These {hort and abrupt exclamations are very
natural, and have quite a dramatic air. The image of his
little farm and cottage being plunder'd, breaks in upon the
ffegherd, ancl quite disorders his mind. The irony in the fol-
owmg lines, ²

I⁷fi²re nunc, Meliboee, piros, &c-
strongly expresses both grief and indignation-
