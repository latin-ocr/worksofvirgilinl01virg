THE LIFE OF VIRGIL. 21

by too deep diffimulation: for his council, thinking to
make their court by assenting to his judgment‚ voted
unanimoussy for him against his inclination, which sur-
prized and troubled him to such a degree, that as soon
as he got-into his coach he fell into a swoon. But Caesar
knew his people better; and his council being thus di-
vidcd‚ he asked Virgil’s advice. Thus a poet had the
honour of determining the greatest point that ever was
in debate‚ betwixt the son-in-law, and favourite of Caesar.
virgil delivered his opinion in words to this effee’c: The
change of a popular into an absolute government‚ has
generally been of very ill consequence: for betwixt the
hatred of the people‚ and injustice of the prince, it of
neceffity comes to pass that they live in distrust and
mutual apprehenfion. But if the commons knew ajust
person, whom they entirely confided in, it would be for
the advantage of all parties that such a one should be
their sovereign. Wherefore if you shall continue to ad-
minister justice impartially, as hitherto you have done,
your power will prove safe to yourself, and beneficial to
mankind. This excellent sentence, which seems taken
out of Plato (with whose writings the grammarians were
not much acquainted‚ and therefore cannot reasonably be
suspected of forgery in this matter) contains the true
state of affairs at that time: For the commonwealth
maxims were now no longer prafflcable3 the Romans
had only the haughtiness of the old commonwealth left,
without one of its virtues. And this sentence we find,
almost in the same words, in the first book of the AEneis,
which at this time he was writing ; and one might won-
der that none of the commentators have taken notice of

it. He compares a tempest to a popular insurre&ion,

as Cicero had compared a sedition to a storm a little
before.
