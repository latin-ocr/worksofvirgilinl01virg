gustus, he composed the Tityrus, introducing in it two

we are told that when he returned to take poss'effion of his
farm, he was violently ass'aulted by the intruder, and would
certainly have been killed by him, if he had not made his

of Theocritus he had by him. One stroke in it is too
artful to be omitted. He advises the ss1epherd to consult
no more the old constellations and signs as they were
wont to do, but to look up to a brighter star, the Julium
Sidus,-alluding to the famous comet which is said to
have appeared seven days after Julius Caesar’s death, and
was faneied by the vulgar to he Caesar’s soul converted
by Venus into a blazing star· Suetonius speaks of it in
