Ες1.5·, - THE Ἑριοουὲε or Vmerr.. 131

The sylvan wars of cruel hunters cease,

Daphnis the rnild loves universal peace.

The desert mountains into finging break,

The forests and the fields in transport speak3 7 ς
The rocks proclaim the new divinity Ξ

A god, a god ! the vocal hills reply.

' O hear thy worshippers ! four altars see,

For Phoebus tvm, and Daphnis, two for tl‘lee !

Two jars of fattest oil, each‘ rolling year, 80
Two bowls of frothing milk to thee I'll bear 3

The ritual feast shall overflow with wine,

, {and Chios’ richest nef'tar shall be thine3

On the warm hearth in winter’s chilling hour

We'll sacrifice; a summer in a bow’r; 85
ἢ Alphefiboeus tripping shall advanee,

And mimie satyrs in the festal danee ς

Damoetas there and skilful Aegon smg 3

And constantly our off'rings will We bring,

Both to the nymphs when sacred rites are paid,² 90
And when the vitilium round the fields are led t

While the cicada fips the dew, while thyme

The bees shall suck, while boars the mountains climb‚
While fishes wanton in the wat'ry waste,

So long thy honour, 'name and praise shall last. 95
Those holy Vows which on a solemn day,

At Bacchus' and at Ceres' shrine we pay,

Daphnis to thee shall rise each circling year: Ι

Thou too {halt be invok'd and hear our pray'r !

99. Thou—hear our prayer] RUAEUS has well explained
this passage: He who makes a vow defires something from
God, and promises something to him at the same time. If
God grants his request, then he, who makes the vow, is in a
mannerjudged‚ and obliged to perform his promise. Thus
God is said damnare votis or voti, when he grants the request‚
and so obliges the person to perform what he had promised.
