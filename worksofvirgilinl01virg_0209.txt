‚ EcLOGUE THE TENTH.

GALLUS.

I D the last labour of my rural muse,
'Tis Gallus asks, auspicious Arethuse!

But then such pityamoving strains impart,
Such numbers as may touch Lycoris' beart 3
Yet once more, tuneful nymph, thy succour bring3 5
What bard for Gallus can refuse to fing ?
So while beneath Sicilian seas you glide,
May Doris ne’er pollute your purer tide ἒ

With Gallus’ hapless love begin the lay,
While browze the goats thetend‘er-budding spray3 10

⁴ Nor to the deaf our mournful notes we fing,

Each wood shall with responfive echoes ring.

Where were ye, Naiads ! in what lawn or grove,
When Gallus pin'd with unregarded love ?

For not by Aganippe’s spring we play'd, 15
Nor Pindus' verdant hill your steps delay’dg

For him lamented every laurel grove ;

The very tamasiscs wept his hapless love3

His woes ev'n pineatopt Maenalus bemoan’d,

Thro' all his caverns the dark mountain groan'd ς 20
And cold Lycaeum’s rocks bewail'd his fate,

As sad beneath a lonelf'cliff' he sate.

Around him stood his flock in dumb surprize‚

A {hepherd's lowly name Ι ne’er despise τ’

Nor thou, sweet hard, disdain fair flocks to gulde, 25
Adonis fed them by the river’s fide, ·

j The heavy hind to him, and goat· -herd haste,
¹ And old Menalcas wet {rom gathering wint’ ry mast;

An of his love enquire3 Apollo came3

‘Why glows my Gallus’ breast with fruitless flame ἓ 30 ᾗ
