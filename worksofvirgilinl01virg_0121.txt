Ed, 2. Tun Ecroouzs 01- Vnum„ 9¹

The privet's filver flow’rs we still negle&,
But dusky hyacinths with care collect.
Thou know'st not whcm thou scorn'st-what snowy kine,
What luscious milk, what rural stores are mine !
Mine are a thousand lambs in yonder vales, 25
My milk in summer’s drought, nor winter fails3
Nor sweeter to his herds Amphion sung,
While with his voice Boeotia’s mountains rung3
Nor am I so deform'd! myself I view’d
On the smooth surface of the glaffy flood, 30
By winds unmov’d‚ and be that image true,
’Ῑ dread not Daphnis’ charms, tho’ judg'd by you.
O that you lov’d the fields and shady grots‚
To dwell with me in bowers, and lowly cots,
'To drive the kids to sold, the stags to pierce3 35
Thenllhould'st thou emulate Pan'e sszilful verse,
Warbling with me in woods ; 'twas mighty Pan
To join with wax the various reeds began ;
Pan, the great god of all our subject plains‚
Prote& and loves the cattle and the swains 3 40
Nor thou disdain‚ thy tender rosy lip
Deep to indent with [neh a master's pipe.
To gain that art how much Amyntas try’d ἒ
This pipe Damoetas gave me as he dy'd3
ἱ Seven joints it boasts-Be thine this gift, he said : 45
{Amyntas envious figh’d, and hung the head.

Nec sum adeo iaefformis .· nuper me in littore vidi,
Cum placidum ventis staret mare?

 

His wonderful judgment for once deserted him, or he might
have retained the sentiment with a ssight change in the appli-
cation. Huan’s letter on the marks of imitation.

41. Rosp lip.] There is a fondness in mentioning thie cir-
cumstance of his wearing his lip.-This fistula is used to this
day in the Grecian issands. The constant effe& of playing
on it, is making the lip thick and callous. Mr. Dawkins
affured me he saw several shepherds with such lips.

45. Joints.] Servius tells us, that Cicuta means the space
between the two joints of a reed.
