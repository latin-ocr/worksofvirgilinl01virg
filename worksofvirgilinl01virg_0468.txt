diffion, a spirit unextinguished by correc‘mess and rhylneg·
to be found in ΜΓ. POPE's Effay on Man, that will ever
render it the honour of our nation and language0· And'
it is not my province at present to determine, what some
are apt to disputet, Whether or no this poem (in the'
words of Dr. Warburton) ‘⁶ hath a precifion, force, and

‘The PLEASURES oF IMAcrnArroN are,- in their very
nature, a most proper and pregnant subjetst for a didaffiffc
poem. The amiable author who happily fixt on these
as his subjeet, it must be allowed by the severest critic,-
hath done them ample justice3 whether we consider his

images†; the gracefu'l and harmonious flow of his
number53 or the noble spirit of poetica} enthusiasm,
which breathes through his whole work. But that I
may not lose myself in a wide field of panegyric, Iwill'
produce the fpllowing three passages, in which images
of Greatness‚ Wonderfulness‚ and Beauty (from the
perception of which all the pleasures of poetry and the
imagination principally flow) are thus nobly exemplify'd„

1. GREATNESS.

—-- The high-born soul
Disdains to rest his heav’n aspiring wing
Beneath its native quarry. Tir'd of earth
And this diurnal scene, she springs alost
Through fields of air; pursues the flying storm3
