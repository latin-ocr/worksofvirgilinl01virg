THE LIFE oF VIRGIL. ις

In which Ode one cannot forbear observing that the poet,
conscious of the dignity of the person he was writing to,
has exerted his geniuS, and warmed his fancy, and has
given us some of the most spirited and sublime images
that are to be found in his works z

Jam nunc minaci murmure cornuum
Perstringis aures3 jam litui strepunt!
Jam fulgor armorum fugaces
Terret equos equitumque vzcltu53
Audire magnos jam videor duces
Non indecoro pulvere sordidos Ι

Pollio was likewise the first whoerecsted a public libra-
ry at Rome, adorned with curious busto's of the most ce-
lebrated writers. He had a most delicate taste for the fine
arts, particularly architectum and sculpture ι Pliny tells
us, that some of the capital pieces of the most exquisite
Grecian artists were in his collection 3 particularly, a Si-
lenus, a Neptune, an Apollo, and some Bacchanalian
Nymphs, all by Praxiteles ; which are particularly men-
tioned in the fifth chapter of the thirty-fixth book of his
Natural History. It was none of the smallest honours.
Virgil met with, to be protected and esteemed by this all-
accomp‘lissled courtier.

In the last Eclogue our Author composed, he introduces
his friend Cornelius Gallus, lying disconsolately under
a mountain in Arcadia, bitterly bewailing the inconstancy
of his mistress, and surrounded by all the rural gods, and
by Apollo himself, who come to sympathize with him in
his grief, and endeavour to administer comfort to him.
He had before paid Gallus a high compliment in his Si-
lenus, representing him wandering on the banks of Per-
messus, and met by one of the Muses, who leads him to
the Aonian mountains, where the whole affembly of gods

and poets rises up to greet his approach, and Linus gives
him the pipe of old Hefiod :
