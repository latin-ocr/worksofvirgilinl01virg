ὃὸ A Diffi’rtatt'on upon Pan-our POETRY.

of the death of some illustrious person, whom when·
once the poet has called a shepherd, he has no longer
any labour upon his hands, but can make the clouds
weep, and lilies wither, and the sheep hang their heads,
without art or learning, genius or study.

It is part of Claudian’s charaecm of his rustic, that he
computes his time not by the succession of consuls, but
of harvests. Those who pass their days in retreats dis-

expected to make way for another, they have written with
an utter disregard both of life and nature, and filled their
produecions with mythological allufions, with incredible
fictione, and with sentiments which neither paffion nor
reason could have dietated, fince the change which reli·

several pastoral writers, I would say, that in Theocritus
we arc charmed with a certain sweetnesS, a romantio
rusticity and wildness, heightened by the Doric dialcet,
that are almost inimitable. ’Tis worth remarking, that
he hath borrowed many beautiful images from the most

exquisite pastoral now extant, Ι mean the Song of Solomon; 1
¹ which he probably had read with pleasure in the Greek
⁴ transsation of the Seventy Interpreters, who were his ’

cotemporaries in the polite court of Ptolomy. Several of
his pieces indicate a genius of a higher class, far superior
to Pastoral, ancl equal to the sublimest specics of poetry :

such are particularly, his Panegyric 011 Ptolomy, the
