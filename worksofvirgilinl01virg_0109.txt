Nay, mine's not envy‚ swain, but glad surprise 3
O'er all our fields such scen'es of rapine rise!
And lo! sad part’ner of the general care, 15
Weary and faint I drive my goats afar,
While scarcely this my leading hand sustaIns‚
Tir'd with the way, and recent from her pain85
For mid' yon tangled hazles as we past,
On the bare flints her hapless twins [he cast, 20
The hopes and promise of my ruin'd fold !
These ills prophetie figns have oft foretold3
Oft from yon hollow tree th' hoarse raven's croak‚
And heaven's quick lightning on my blasted oak :

Where, Meliboeus, with our fleecy care,
We shepherds to the markets oft repair. 30
So like their dams I kidlings wont to call,
So dogs with whelps compar’d, so great with small 2

'Twas Freedorn call’d3 and I, tho? ssow, obey’d.
She carne at last, tho' late she blest my sight,
When age had filver’d o'er my beard with white ς
But ne'er approach'd till my revolting breast
Had for a new exchang'd its wonted guest : 40
There Amaryllis reigns3 yet sure 'tis true,

While Galatea did my soul subdue,

&flegon-y, that verse Mirabar quid moesta deos, is inextricabte.
