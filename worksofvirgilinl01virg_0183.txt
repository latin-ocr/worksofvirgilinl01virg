Ecl. 7. Tm: Ecnocuns or VIRGIL. 153

T HYRsxs.
Loveliest in walks the pine, the aih in woods,
F irs on the mountains‚ poplars in the floods 3
Fair Lycidas, revifit oft' my field,
Pine, poplar, fir, and aih to thee shall yield! 70
MELIBOEUS.
Thus Thyrfis strove, but vanquish’d were his strain33
And Corydon without a rival reigns.
