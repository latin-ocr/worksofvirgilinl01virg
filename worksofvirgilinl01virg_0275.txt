With the proud oak, beneath whose aweful {hade
Religious rites fond Greece devoutly paid.

Some pour an infant forest from their roots‚

Thus ehns and cherries spring in frequent ihoots.
s 'Thus too, their tender‘ top-s Parnaffus' bays, 25
Beneath their mother‘s sslel‘tering snadow, saise.

So spring, as nature variouz means approves,

Or woods, or snrszs, or consecrated groves.

Yet other means, bath fage ctzpcrience found ;

This, from the mother-trunk‚ within the ground 30
The tendor sucker sets ; another takes

Of larges growth, cross—split‚ or sslarpen'd stakes.

And oft, in native earth, the bought} we see

Inverteo'‚ multiply the parent trce:

Nor fears the gard'ner oft, the smallest {boot 35
To trust to earth 3 -somc ask not for a root.

Nay from cleft olive-trunks with age decay’d

New fibres {hoot‚ and springs a wond’rous {hade-

Even different kinds a mutual change affume,

And still improv’d, with ali-cn foliage bloom3 40
*By ptiar—trees are ingrafted apples borne,

And stony corneils blussfing plums adom.

search then, ye fanneam, with sagacious mind,

How best to manage every various kind.

With culture civilize your savage trees, 45
*Nor let your lands lie dead in ssothful ease. ι·

.What joy the grapes on Ismarus to crop,

And clothe with olives huge Taburnus’ top ἔ

-that seem totally dead in the trunk‚ and yet have very fiourifh-
ing young heads. The same is osten as mrprizing in old wil-
lows; of which Ι have seen several (aa-vd particular}y some in
the garden issand in St. jar-nes’s Parlz) which send down a tap-
root from their heads th‘fough the ῑῑυηὲῑ, that often seems in—
tirely deeayed; and so folm a young erce on an old stock,
which looks as flouris'n'ing as the other does rotten. Sparsos.
