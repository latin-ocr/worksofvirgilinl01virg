Ϊςὴίεέεά. The dedication is then made to the poet's divinity,
ugU us:

In medio mihi CAESAR erit, templumque tenebit.

TEMPLUM ΤΕΝΕΒΙΤ. The expreffion is emphatical; as inti-
mating to us, and prefiguring the secret purpose of the Aeneis,
which was, in the person of Aeneas, to ssiadow forth and
consecrate the charaster of Augustus. His divinity was to fill
and occupy that great work. And the ample circuit and magni-
ficence of the epic plan was projeEted only, as a more aweful
enclosure of that august presence, which was to inhabit and.
solemnize the vast round of this poetic building.

And now the wonderful address of the poet's artifice appears.
The mad servility of his country had deffied the emperor in
good earnest: and his brother poets made no scruple to worship
in his temples‚ and to come before him with handfuls of real
incense, smoking from the altars. Eut the sobriety of Virgil's ,
adoration was of another cast. He seizes this circumstance onlv ⁴
to mbo& a poetical fithom which, on the suppofition of an
aecual dezficcztion, bath all the force of compliment‚ which the
fab? impliee, and yet, as presented through the chaste veil of «
allegor-y, eludes the monstrous offence, which the nakedreciral
must needs have given to decency and common senses Had
the emperors popular divinity been fiatly acknowledged‚ and
adm-ed, the praste, even under Virgil's management, had been
insufferable for its extravagance5 and without some support for
his poetical numen to rest upon, the figure had been more
forced and strained, than the rules ofjust writing allow. As
it is, the historical truth of his apotheofis authorizes and sup-
ports thefiffliom and the fifflon, in its turn, serves to refinc and .
palliate the histmy.

The Aeneis being, by the poet's improvement of this cir-
cumstance, thus naturally pre—dielcd under the image of a .
temple, w'e may expe& to find a close and studied analogy be-
twixt them. The great, component parts of the orare, will no
doubt be made, very fasthfussy, to represent and adumbrate ⁴
those of the other. This hath been executed with great art
and diligence. .

1. The temple, we obser-ved, was erected on the banks of a
river. This fite was not only proper for the reason already ⁶
mentioned, but also, for the further convenience of instituting
public games, the ordinary attendants of the consecration os
temples. These were generally, as in the case of the Olympie
and others, celebrated on the banks of rivers.
