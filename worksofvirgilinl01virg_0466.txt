And tail erait, neighing he paws the ground3
Fierce rapture kindles in his red'ning eyes,
And boils in every vein.—-- B, ii.- ἐφ

The descriptions of hunting the hare, the fox, and ther
stag, are extremely spirited, and place the very objects
before our eye53 of such consequence is it for a man to
write on 'that which he hath frequently felt with plea⁴¹
sure. He negle&s his verfification sometimeS, and there
are doubtless great inequalities‚ both with respe& to hara
mony and expreffion, in the poem. He hath failed in de-
scribing the madness that sometimes rages among houndsq
and particularly in his account of the effeets of the bite

of a mad dog on a man.

To describe so difficult a thing,- gracefirlly and poeti-f
cally‚ as the effeets of a distemper on the human body,
was reserved for Dr. ARMsTR0N03 who accordingly

2 hath nobly executed it, at the end of the third book of
his Art of preserving healssr, where he hath given us that
pathetic account of the sweating-fickness. There is a
claffical correctness and closeness of style in this poem,
that are truly admirable, and the subjee'c is raised and-
adorned by numberless poetical images. What can be
more pleafing than his description of a healthy situation

for a house ἒ

See l where enthron'd in adamantine state,

Proud of her bards imperial Windsor sits;
There choose thy seat, in some aspiring grove
Fast by the ssowly-winding Tharnen or where
Broader she laves fair Richmond’s green retreats 3
(Richmond that sees an hundred villas rise
Rural or gay). Ο from the summer's tage

O wrap me in the friendly gloom that hides
Umbrageous Ham.

This ends with a 'well-conducied prosopopoeia.
