DIDAch POETRY. 4‘13

Tum liquidas corvi preffo ter gutture voces

Aut quater ingeminant 3 et saepe cubilibus altis,
Nescio qua praeter solitum dulcedine laeti

Inter se foliis strepitant 3 juvat imbribus αέῗίς
Progeniem parvam, dulcesque revisere nidos.

And it must be granted that the Greek verses are extremely
good, and indeed little inferior to Virgil's ;

Ka» κοξακες μενοι μεν, &emmam βοωοντες
Δισσακις ava-ag επειτσι μεταθξοοι κεκλήγοντες.
Πλειοτεξοι δ’ αγεληχὲον επην »conone μεδωνται,
Φωνης εμπλειοι, >gangen κε ’τις mco-orto,

Ome τοι μιν, βοοωσι, λιγαινομενοισιν ὅμοια.

Πολλα δε &Remoto wege φλοον comen? επ’ cem-or,

Ηχι τε κειεσιν και ὖποτξοποι απἻεξυοντ-αι.

But wrsat virgil adds is purely his own: when he ac-
counts for this unusual joy, by the various effeets which
the alteration of the air will have on their bodies, in the
most perspicuous and beautiful terms :

Haud equidem credo quia stt divinitus illis

Ingenium, aut rerum fata prudentia major;

Verum, ubi tempestas et coeli mobilis humor,
Mutavere vias, et Jupiter humidus austris

Densat, erant quae rara modo, et quae densa relaxat:
V crtuntur species animorum, et peeJora motus

ZVunc alios, alies, dum nubila ventus agebat,
Concipiunt. ’

To express such abstruse notions with so much clearness
and grace, is a great instance of Virgil's supreme mas⁴
tery of language.

On the whole, Aratus appears to have a great deal of
nature, but not much dignity and vivacity in his manner.
His charae’oer is so finely and so justly drawn by Qin-
tiliam, and is applicable to so many didaffic poets, that I
shall give it to the reader without apology for so many
