PREFATORY Dtch‘rmN. ἰι

Mr. Pope) “ are far from striking us in this' open
“ manner3 they lie in a ‘great' degree hidden and
“ undistinguished‚ and where they are marked most
‘⁶ evidently, affe& us not in proportion to those
·“ of Homer. His charafters of valour are much
“ alike 5⁴ even that of Turnus seems no way pecu-
“ liar, but as it is in a different degree: and we
-‘·‘ see nothing that differences the courage of
“ Mnestheus frorn that of Sergestus, Cloanthus,
“ and the rest.'' Perhaps it may be urged, thar·
the chargster of AEneas‚ which is entirely of our
poet’s own formation, and in which wisdom, piety,
'and courage are so happily blended and temperet}
with each other, may in some measure atone for
this deficiency. ——The other seeming blemish is,
that in reading the last fix books, one cannot sor·
bear pitying Turnus, who undoubtedly ought to
have been drawn with some fault or other to
have excited our averfion, or raised our indigna-
tion. But to see avaliant young prince, robbed o}
a mistress whom he paffionately loved and who re⁴ =
turned his paffion, and to whom he was even be‹
trothed3 nay to behold him,murdered‚ while he
fights to maintain his claim to her, by a perfet‘t
stranger‚ who has nothing to plead for his conduc}
but the gods and oracles3 are circumstances that
while they prejudice the reader against AEneas‚
deeply interest him for Turnus. It were to be
wished the poet had either given the latter some
unamiable quality, or else had represented Lavinia
as averse to the match. All that can be said in
Ι 6 defence
