Frena Pelethronii Lapithae, gyrosque dedere x 15
Inpofiti dors03 atque equitem docuere sub armis
Insultare solo, et greffus glomerare superbos.

Aequus uterque labor ε’ aeque juvenemque magistri
Exquirunt, calidumque animis et cursibus acrem.
Qamvis‘saepe fuga versos ille egerit hostis, 120'
Et patriam Epirum referat, fortisque Mycenas; >
Neptunique ipsa deducat origine gentem.

His animadversis instant sub tempus, et omnis
Inpendunt curas denso distendere pingui,

Qem legere ducem, et pecori dixere maritum : 125
Pubentesque secant herbas, fluviosque ministrant,
Farraque 3 ne blando nequeat* supereffe labori ς
Invalidique patrum referant jejunia gnati z ,

163. Form his pliantfl’et] There are several lin'es in thia
third Georgic, which shew that the manege was found out
much earlier than some would imagine. witness the fol-low*-
ing pafl‘age:

Gyrosque dedere
Inpfflti dorst-
And that other,

Carpere mox gyrum incipiat, Sec.

The simile just after was meant to shew, a violently swift‚ but
at the same time a level and uniform motion. Honnswok‘ru.

170. Without they} virtues] Ι received the following ob-
servations on this passage from a very ingenious gendeman.

Ι have always been absolutely at a loss to make out the con·
neclion of these three lines [in the original] with the foregoing.
Transsators and Commentators make quamvis refer to some-
thing which is certainly not express‘ed there, nor Ι think im-
plied, or i-nfinuated3 nor indeed cons-‚stent with what is there
cxp1effed. How can the horse be supposed saepe versos*
hqstes egiſji’, if he* was not calidus animis ? Qamvis implies an
oppofition between these two, whereas no two things can be
more naturally connefted. You have got over the difficulty as
well as your neighbours, but 1 think it is insuperable, as the
text now stands. Befides, quamvls implies that the horse above
described was rejec‘led, not that he was-fought out, and chosm-
In ffiort 1 am persuaded, these three lines are not in their
right place. Suppose them placed as follows:

Hunc quoque, ubi aut morbo gravis, aut jam segnior annis
Deficit, abde domo ς nec turpi ignosce finellae.
