THE LIFE OF VIRGIL. 11

brated Eclogue intitled usually, but perhaps falssy, Pollio,
as it related to the birth of his son Salonius. But Ca-
trou has endeavoured to fhew that this is a gross mistake,
and that the subjeet of it is the birth of young Marcellus,
who was afterwards adopted by Augustus. The sub-
stance of his opinion is as follow53 which will give'us
some insight into this intricate affair.

Caesar did not· remain long in quiet after the compleat
ka'rory which he obtained over Lucius, and Fulvia the
wife of Antony, who had rashly taken arms against him.
This turbulent lady fied to her husband, and incited him ι
to make war upon Caesar. Antony inflamed with tage,
steered his course to Italy 3 and began a most furious and
dangerous war. But the news of the death of Fulvia,
whom he had left fick at Sicyon, coming opportunely,
gave a favourable opportunity of settling a peace between
these mighty rivals. Cocceius, a common friend to both,
went between thern, and projeeted a reconciliation : The
consul Pollio appearing on the part of Antony, and Maess
cenas on the part of Caesar, to arbitrate the differences
between them. The arbitrators proposed, that as Fulvia,
the wife of Antony, was just dead, and Marcellus also,
the husband of Odiavia, half sister to Caesar, chtavia
should be given in marriage to Antony. This being agreed
to, caused an universal joy: and the whole army cxpreffed
theirjoy by shouting all that day, and the following night.
OCtavia was with child at'the timeof this marriage.
Therefore as this great lady, who was also a person of a
most unspotted charaeter, was the cement of so bleffed a
peace and union between the two great Triumvirs, who
were upon the point of tearing the world in sunder by
'their divifions, Virgil was not baekward in testifying his
joy for so happy an event. The Sibilline oracles had
foretold‚ th'at a child was to be born'about this time,
who should rule the world, and establish perpetual peace.
