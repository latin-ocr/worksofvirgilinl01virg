ECLOGUE THE FoURTH.
On the Birth of MARCELLUS.

To POLLIO‘.

’ IVE me, Sicilian maids, sublimes strains5
All love not lowly shrubs and rural plains z
(Or if ye choose to smg the ihady grove,
Make your theme worthy a great consul's love.
The years approach, by Sybils fage foretold, ς
Again by circling time in order roll’d !
Astrea comes, old Saturn's holy reign,
Peace, virtue, justice, now return again l
’‘See a new progeny from heav’n descend ! ἶ
Lucina hear ! th' important birth befriend l ι 10
The golden age this infant shall restore,
Thy Phoebus reigns -and vice {hall be no more.
The months begin, the bahe’s auspicious face,
Pollio, thy glorious consulship shall grace3
What footsteps of our ancient crimes remain 15
For ever shall be banish'd in shy reigna
He shall enjoy the life divine, and see
The gods and heroes of eternsty3
The jarring world in lasting peace shall bind,
2And with his father's virtues sule mankind. q 20
For thee, O child, spontaneous earth shall pour
‘Green ivy, mix'd with ev'ry choicest flow'r:

„“ eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play
¹ “ upon the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put
ξ “ his hand on the adder's den, chap. xi. ver. 6, 7, 8.''

How much inferior is Virgil's poetry to Isaiah’s ! The for-
mer has noth‘sng comparable to these beautiful strokes 3 ‘¹ that

 

⁸‘ a little child ffiall lead the lion 3 that the very- trees of
.“ the forest shall come ῑοΙΡὲῑγ adoration.”--Virgil osffi}
