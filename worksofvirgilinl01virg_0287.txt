Nor all the stores Panchaia's glebe expands,
where spices overflow the fragrant sands ς

, Nor Baetrian, nor Arabian fields can vie

With the blest scenes of beauteous Italy.

Bulls breathing fise her furrows ne'er have known,
Ne’er with the dreadful dragon's teeth were sown,
Whence sprung an iron crop, an armed train,
With helm and spear embattell'd on the plam.
But plenteous corn she boasts, and gen'rous wine,
The luscious olive, and the joyful kiae.

' Hence o'er the plain the warrior-steed elate,
Prances with portly pace in martial state 3

Hence snowy flocks wash'd in thy sacred stream,
Clitumnus, and of victims the supreme

The mighty bull, have led, thro' shouting trains‚
Rome's pompous triumphs to the lofty sanes.
The fields here spring's perpetual beauties crown,
Here summer shines in seasons not her own.

’ Twice teem the cattle each revolving year,

And twice the trees their blushing burthen bear.
Nor here the tygress rears her rav'nous breed,
Far hence is the fell lion's savage seed3

Nor wretched fimplers specious weeds invite,

For wholesome herbs, to crop pale aconite ε

Nor scaly snakes in such vast volumes glide,

Nor on a train so thick, and spires so lofty ride.
Add too around what far-fam'd cities rise,

NVhat stately works of daedal artifice ἔ

With tow'red towns here craggy cliffs are crown'd‚

Here rivers roll oid moss-grown ramparts round.
And shall my song her two-fols} ocean boast‚
That pours its siches forth on. either coast ἓ
