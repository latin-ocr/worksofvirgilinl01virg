Book 2· THE Geonmcs οι·- VIRGIL. 25¹

Th’ extreme of cultivated lands survey,
The painted Scythians, and the realms of day5 140
All trees allotted keep their several coasts,
India alone the sable ebon boasts 3
Sabaea bears the branch of frankincense.
And shall I sing, how teeming trees dispense
Rich fragrant balms in many a trickling tear, 143
With soft Acanthus' berries, never sear ?
From Aethiop woods, where woolly leaves increase,
How Syrians cornb the vegetable fleeee ?
Or shall I tell how India hangs her woods‚
Bound of this earth, o ’er Ocean' s unknown floods? 150
’ Wher e to such height the trees gigantic grow,
T'nat far they leave the founding shaft below,
Tho’ skiil'd the natives are to bend the bow,
The Median fields rich citron fruits produce,
Tho' harlh the taste, and clammy be the juice 3 155
Blest antidote Ι which, when in evil hour
The step-dame mixes herbs of poisonous power,
And crowns the bowl 'with many a mutter'd spell,
Will from the veins the direful draught expell.
Large is the trunk, and laurel-like its frame‚ 160
And 'twere a laurel, were its scent the same.
Its lasting leaf each roaring blast defies,
*Tenacious of the stem its flourets rise t
Hence a more wholesome breath the Medes receive,
And of pale sires the lab'ring lungs relieve. 163
But neither Media’s groves, her teeming mold,
, Fair Ganges' stood, nor Hermus thick with gold3

Inverte‘re, satzs inmanis dentibus hydri,

he alludes to the famous story of Jason. Mr. Thornson has

celebrates Great Britain. See his Summer.
