'Tis after this manner virgil judicioussy conceals the
nakedness and barrenness of his subje8c, by the lustre of

he turneth every thing he touches into gold.

I ssiass now endeavour to point the merit or imperfezffion
of the most celebrated didafflc poet52 ancient and mo-
dern, by giving a {hort and I hope impartial account of
each. I shall begin with Hefiod'‚ whose charatfi‘ter has
been drawn by Mr. Addison in the following words.

not ssir out of the field once in the whole Georgic. His
