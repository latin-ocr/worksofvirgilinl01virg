VIRGIL.

ECLOGUE THE FIRST.

TITYRUS.

ΜΕιῙΒοΕυε, ΤΙτΥιωε.

ΜειῙΒοΕυε.

ΙΝ beechen studes, you Tit’rus‚ stretcht along,
Tune to the ssender reed your sylvan song 3

‘Weleave our country's bounds, our much-lov'd plains,
We from our country fly, unhappy swains !

You, Tit’rus, in the groves at leisure laid, 5
Teach Amaryllis’ name to every ssiade.
TITYRUS.

O 'twas a god these bleffings, swain, bestow’d,

For still by me he shall be deem'd a god!

For him the tend’rest of my fleecy breed

Shall oft in solemn sacrifices bleed. ιο

He gave my oxen, as thou see'st‚ to stray,
And me at ease my fav'rite strains to play.

⁵ 7. 'Twas a god.] This is pretty high flattery, oetavius had
not yet received divine honours, which were afterwards bestow-
ed on him: but Virgil speaks as if he werealready deified.
This was the language of the courtiers of that time.

Prefinti tibi maturos largimur bonores,

says Horace. One cannot but recolleEk, on reading such sort
of passages, the words of the spirited historian: Igitur verso
civitatis stata, nihil usquam prisci {3³ integri moris : omnis exuta'
aequalitatejtffz principis aspediare„ Tacitus, Annal. lib. i. c. 4.
