Book 3. THE GEORGICS OF VIRGIL. 327

Mean time the skies arc dim with falling snows3 455
Thick clouds of sseet th' unwieldy ox enclose :
In growing heaps benumb’d, the crowding deer
Scarce from* beneath, their branching antlcrs rear ε
Not these with hounds the hunter-train surprize‚
With nem, or feathers dipt in purple dies3 460
But with the sword invade them, while in vain
Against the huge semustam load they strain,
While void of help, in piteous sounds they bray3
Then home, with {houts of triumph bear the prey.
In caverns deep, with oak uppil'd, they raise, 465
And many a branching elm, the craekling blaze ;
From cold secur'd, around the flaming hearth‚
Waste the long drea-:y night in social mirth:
Guiltless of wine, the goblet still goes round,
With Ceres’ juice, and sparkling cyder crown’d. 479
Such is the racc of savage swains that lie
Beneath the rigours of the polar ss<y;
And sore afflissed by the piercing east,
Their limbs with fui-s and brinded skins invest.
Is wool thy care ? avoid the shaggy ground, 475
Where thistles and the prickly bur abound.
Nor let too fat a soil thy choice invite ;
Choose first a flock with fleeces soft and white.
Tho’ white thy ram, yet if a swarthy tongue
Appears beneath his humid palate hung, 480
Reje& him, lest he blacken all the breed,
And let another to the task succeed.
Thus by a snowy fleece, th’ Arcadian god
Drew down pale Cynthia from her bright abode 3
Nor did’st thou, queen of night, disdain his love, 485
Pleas'd with the cheat, thou met'st him in the grove.
⁷ If milk thou lov’st, with lillies from the brook,
§oft leaves, and salted herbage feed thy flock ἑ
