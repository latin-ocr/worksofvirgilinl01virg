THE
GEORGICS
OF·

VIRGIL.

BOOK THE THIRD.

’, HY praises too, great Pales, will we fing,

With thee fam’d {hepherd of Amphrysus' spring3

Ye too, Lycaeus’ groves, and guffiing streams,
For vain are ancient tales, and vulgar themes3
Who knows not all the songs that once cou'd please‚ 5
Bufiris’ shrines, Eurystheus’ dire decrees?
Can Dian’s isse, ox· Hylas, longer charm?
Or Pelops famous for his ivory arm,
Whose steeds vifiorious in the dusty sace
Won him the fair Hippodame's embrace ? ιο
Ιτοο must find a path untrod before,
And far from groveling earth, to fame sublitnely soar.

I first of Romans to th' Hesperian plain,
Will lead th’ Aonian nymphs, if life remain :

> Ι first will bid Idumes’ palms arise, 15
Exchange their soil, and bloom in Mantuan sszies.

Olympie ode of Pindar is to be understood by the mention of
Hippodamia and Pelops. He breaks out at last into a noble
triumph of assurance, that he shall rival these Greek poet-5:

Tentanda via cst, qua me quoque poffi'm

Tollere humo, vidorque virz‘lm volitare per cra.

Mr. Pope used to say, that this triumph of virgil over the
Greek poets, was one of the vainest things that eves was writ.
κ —But surely its sublimity makes amends for this imputed

r vanity.
