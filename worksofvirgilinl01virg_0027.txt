PRtrAToRY DEDmA—mon. xvii

In fine, if my partiality to Mr. Pitt does not
missead me, I should think he has executed his
work with great spirit, that he has a fine flow of
harmonious verfification, and has rendered his
author's sense with faithfulness and perspicuity3 but
my testimony can be of little consequence in this
case3 and there is no reason to doubt but he will
stand by his own intrinfic merit ; which the public
hath already sufficiently approved.

Ι thought it proper to premise these few reflec-
tions, on Virgil, on Mr. Pitt, and myself, before Ι
ventured to give the following transsation into your
hands; Idar‘ed notsay, ’

--- in Meti descendat judicis aures,

till I had endeavoured to point out the peculiar
difficulties attending this performance, and had
obviated any charge of envy, or even of emula-
tion, in attempting it after ΜΓ. Dryden. I have
only to add, that among other reasons why I could
wilh this work may reach posterity‚ one of the
greatest is, that it may be known, I enjoyed the
favour and friendship of Sir GEORGE LYTTELTON.
