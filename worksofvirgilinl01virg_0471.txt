DIDACTIC POETRY. 435

As with the blushes of an evening sky?

Or wilt thou rather stoop thy vagrant plume,
Where, gliding thro’ his daughter’s honour’d finde,
The smooth Peneus from his glass'y flood

Ressec‘ts purpurea} Tempe’s pleasant scene ?

F air Tempe l haunt belov’d of sylvan pow'rs,

Of nymphs and fauns 3 where in the golden age
They play'd in secret on the {hady brink

With ancient Pan, while round their choral steps
Young hours and genia] gales with constant hand
Shower'd bloffoms‚ odours, ffiower’d ambrofial dews,
And Spring's Elyfian bloom.

I must beg the reader’s leave to lay before him one ι
passage more, with which I shall conclude, both because ¹
it is a proper instance of our author's genius, and because
it contains a strong and seasonable exhortation to the
stedy of the Grecian literature, which is at present so
strangely neglecsted among us, that persons are not want-
ing who set up for scholars and critics, without even
pretending ever to have perused the Greek claffics.

Genius of ancient Greece! whose faithful steps
VVeH-pleas’d I follow thro’ the sacred paths
Of nature and of science3 nurse divine

Of all heroic deeds and fair defires ἕ

O l let the breath of thy extended praise
Inspire my kindling bosom to the height

Of this untempted theme. Nor be my thoughts
Presumptuous counted, if, amid the calm
That soothes this vernal evening into smiles,

I steal impaticnt from the sordid haunts

Of strife and low ambition to attend

Thy sacred presence in the sylvan iliade,

By their malignam footsteps ne’er profan'd.
uescenti, propitiousl to my favour’d eye5
Such in thy miei), thy wan-n, exaltedjzir,
