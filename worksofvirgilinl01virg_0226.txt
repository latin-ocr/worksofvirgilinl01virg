Qffl locus Erigonen inter Chelasque sequentis,
Panditur. ipse tibi jam brachia contrahit ardens
Scorpios, et coeli justa plus parte reliquit. 35· ⁴,
Qicquid eris 3 (nam te nec sperent Tartara regern,
Nec tibi regnandi veniat tarn dira cupido:
Qamvis Elysios miretur Graecia campos,
Nec repetita sequi curet Proserpina matrem) ,
Da facilem cursum, atque audacibus adnue coeptis, 40
Ignarosque viae mecum miseratus agrestis
Ingredere, et votis jam nunc adsuesce vocari. l

the emperor To say the truth, there could scarce have been

a place or 'employmenss better chosen for Augustus. The
astronomcrs originally were at a loss how to have the Balance‘
suppoi ted. · they were obliged, for this purpose, to make Scor-

pius take up the space of two signs m the zodiac3 which was
