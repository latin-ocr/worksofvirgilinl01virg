ADiffertatz‘on upo‘n PAs'roRAL Posrrm. ” 67

Ῑ know thee, Love, wild as the raging main,

More fierce than tygers on vthe Lybian plain,
Thou wert from Etna's burning entrails torn,
Begot in tempests, and in thunders born !

Sentiments like these’ as they have ΠΟ ground in naal²¹v

ture, are indeed of little value in any poem; but in
Pastoral they are particularly liable to censure, because
ξ’ they are more proper for tragic or heroic writings.

Pastoral being the representation of cm ac‘lion or paffi0n‚

by its effiHs upon ιι countzsz⁴ left, has nothing peculim⁴ but ’
its confinement to rural imagery‚ without which it ceases ,

to be Pastoral. This is its true characteristic, and this
it cannot lose by any dignity of sentiment, or beauty of
diffion. The Pollio of Virgil, with all its elevation, is
a composition truly Bucolic, though rejected by the cria-
tics 3 for all the images are either taken from the coun-
try, or from the religion of the age common to all parts
of the empire.

The Silenus is indeed ofa more disputable kind, because
though the scene lies in the country, the song being rea
¹ligious and historical, had been no less adapted to* any
other 'audience or place ε Neither can it well be defended
as a fiction, for the introduffion of a God= seems to imply
the Golden Age, and yet he alludes to many subsequent
transactione, and mentions Gallus the Poet's cotem-
porary.

It seems necessary to the perfectiori of this poem,
that the occasion which is supposed to produce it, be at
least not inconsistent with a country life, or less likely
to interest those who have retired into places of solitude
and quiet, than the more busy part of mankind. It i‘s
therefore improper to give the ti‘tle of a Pastoral to
verses, in which the speakers, after the ssight mention of
their flocks, fall to complaints of errors in the church,
and corruptions in the government‚ or to lamentations
