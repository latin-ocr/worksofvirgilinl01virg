Ver. 1. Honey.] The poet calls honey aerial and heavenly,
according to the opinion of the old philosophers, who believed
that it was derived from the dew of heaven. This heavenly
desv they thought was received by the flowers‚ and thence ga-.
thered by the bees. Every reader of taste perceives how virgil
exalts and dignifies these wonderful inse-615, by ascribing to
them thro' this whole book, the manners, paffions, and astions
of men. Ι have before said, that the charaekeristic of this
book is elegmce, and of the former, sublimity. virgil has
borrowed most of his observationffupon bees from Van-0, and
Aristotle’s treatise of animals. Modern philosophy has cleared
up many mistakes which these ancients fell into, with regard
to bees and other animals.
