Book 3'. ‘THE Geoaorcs or me. 291

These hands a fane of Pasiam stone {hall build,
Where Mincio’s stream bedews the verdant field3

’ And spreading wide his Iing’ring waters‚ feeds

Around his winding shores the tendes reeds. 20

as the poet defigned it should, much of that broadglare, in
which writers ofless judgment love to shew their ideas, as tend-
ing to set the common reader at a gaze. The allegory then
proceeds:

Primus ego in patriam mecum, modo vita fitpmstt,
Aonio rediens deducam vertice Ilffufizs.

The proje&ed conquest was no less than that of all the Grecian
Muses at once ; whom,·to carry on the decorum of the allegory,
he threatens‚ 1. to force from their high and advantageous
situation on the summit of the Aonian Μοῑιπΐς and z. to bring
capti-ve with hirn into Italy; theformer circumstance intimating

known to unite in itself whatever is most excellent not in Hoa
mer only, but, universally, in the wits of Greece. The ever-
lasting monument of the marble temple is then reared ι

⁴ And because ancient superstition usually preferred, for these

Purposes, the banks of rivers to other lituations, therefore

, the poet, in beautiful allufion to the fite of some of the most

, celebrated pagan temples, builds his on the Mxncxus. We

see with ‘what' a scrupulous propriety th'e allufion is carried on.

Propter aquam, tardis ingens ubiflexibus errat
M ι Ν CI US, et tenera praetexit arundine ripas.
