DIDAeTxc· POETRY. 403

The landscape which Pouffin painted several times over,
and which is commonly called his Arcadia, would never
have been so celebrated, if it had contained no human
figures. ,
Who has not heard of that famous country, which is
said to have been inhabited by the happiest men that ever
existed on earth ? Men employed only on their pleasures‚
and who knew no other disquietudes‚ than those which
befel the imaginary fhepherds in romances, whose con·

country. In the midst we see the monument of a young
virgin, dead in the flower of her age: this we know by
means of her statue laid at length on her tomb after the

occasion for very serious refleffions, to two young men
and two young maidens,- crcwned with chaplets of flowms,
who seem to have met accidentally with this mournful
monument, in a place where they might well imagine no
melancholy obje& was to be found. One' of their corn-

pointing to it with his finger. And one may perceive, in
the midst of the afflicftion and pity th'at begin to spread
themselves over their features, something of the remains
of an expiring joy. We imaginevwe hear th'e refleef‘tions
of these young persons on the power of death, who
spares neither age, nor beauty3 and against whom the
happiest climates can afford no protetffion. We figure to
ourselves what touching things they would say to on
another, when they recovered from their first surprize,
and we apply these things to ourselves, and to those for
whom we are concerned. It is in poetry asin painting;
and the imitations which poetry makes of nature, touch
