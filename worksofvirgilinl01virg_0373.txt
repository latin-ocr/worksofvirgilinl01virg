By sits, he stamps the ground with eager feet, 610
While from his body bursts a doubtful sweat,

Thac stood in icy drops, as death appear’d ;Δ

'His parch'd hide to the touch is rough and hard.- ·
‘These figns at first his future fate presage ; ¹

But as the spreading pest improv’d its tage, 6153
With sanguine bearns fierce glow'd his ardent eyes,

ι And heav'd his struggling breath with groans and fighs ;

Of blood blank torrents from his nostrils sprung,

To the swoln palate clove his furry tongue.

Some have at first with ihort success apply’d‚ 620
Pour'd thro’ an horn, Lenaeus’ purple tide3

But soon fresh fuel to the growing flame

It gave, and death the medicine became ἐ

While, with bare meeth, their limbs all bath’d in gore‚'
Ev'n in the bitterest dying pangs they tore. 623
O crmvn, ye gods, a pious people's pmy’r,

And let the bad alone so dire an error share !

Lo ἔ while he toils the gallingyoke beneaffi,

Foaming black b!ood., the bullock finks in death:

The penfive hind ‘the brother-steer relieves, 630
Who faithful for his lost companion grieves‚ }
And the fix'd {hare amid the furrow leaves.
*Nor graffy mead, nor {hade of lofty grove,

The mournful mate's affliffsted mind can move ε ι

Nor yet from rocks delicious streams that roll 635
As amber clear, can sooth his sorrowing soul ε

,His flanks flow loose3 his eyes grow dim and dead3

And low to earth he bears his heavy head.

1 Ah Ι what avails their ceaseless useful toil ?

ἐ What boots it to have turn'd the stubborn soil ? 640

It was upon reading these exquifite lines, that Scaliger de-
clared‚ he had rather have been the author of them, than to
have been the first favourite of Croesus or Cyrus. Ι wiss1 there
' was no sentiment in Scaliger's works more extravagant than

this.
