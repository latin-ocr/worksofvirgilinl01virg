Book 1¹. THE Gfioxmcs or Vmcu. ’ 223

The Ioud blast whistles o'er the echoing (hore,
Rustle the murm’ring woods, the rismg billows roar. ⁷
From the frail bark that ploughs the raging main, 430
The greedy waves unwillingly refrain, “
J When loud the corm'rant screams and seeks the land,
And coots and sea-gulls sport upon the sand ;
And the tall hern his marshy haunts forsakes,
And tow'rs to heav’n above the 'custom’d lakes z 435*
Ost, stars fall headlong thro' the {baeles of night,
And leave behind white eracles of trembling light,
In circles play light chaff and wither'd leaves,
And floating feathers dance upon the waves.

But when keen lightnings flasn from Boreas’ pole, 440
= From Eurus’ house to west, when pealing thunders roll,
, The country swims, all delug'd are the dales,
And every pilot furls his humid sails.
Sure warnings still the stormy ffiowers precede 3
The conscjous cranes forsake the vapoury mead, 445
The heifer toffing high her head in air,
With broader nostrils snuffs the gale afar 3 ⁷
Light skims the chirping swallow o'er the flood,
The frogs croak hoarsely on their beds of mud 3
Her eggs abroad the prudent pismire bears, 450
While at her work a narrow road sne wears.
Deep drinks the b0w3 on rustling pinions loud, [crowd.
The crows, a numerous host! from pasture home-ward
·Lo! various sea-som, and each bird that breeds
In Afian lakes, near sweet Cayster’s meads, 455
O'er their smooth ihoulders strive the stream to fling,
And wash in wanton s port each snowy wing3
'Now dive, now run upon the wat'ry plain,
{xnd long to lave their downy plumes in vain ε

452· Deep drinks the bow] Alludes to the ridiculous notion
of the ancients, that the rainbow suck’d up water with its
horns from lakes and rivers.
