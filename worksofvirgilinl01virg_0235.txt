Book 1. THE GEORcrcs OF Vmcn„ 203

Th’ eternal fire, immutably decreed,
That tillage should with toil alone succeed 3
With cares he rous’d, and ssrarpen’d human hearts‚
Bright'ning the rust of indolence by arts.
Ere Jove had reign’d, no swains subdu’d the ground, 155
. Unknown was property, unj ust the mound 3
At will they rov’d3 and earth spontaneous bore,
Unafk'd‚ and uncompell’d, a bounteous store τ
He, to fierce serpents deathful venom gave,
Bade wolves destroy, vbade stormy ocean rave3 160
Conceal'd the fire, from leaves their honey· st100k3
And stopp’d of purple wine each flowing brook ε
That studious want might useful arts contrive3
From planted furrows foodful corn derive 3
And strike from veins of flints the secret spark: 165
Then first the rivers felt the hollow'd bark 3
Sailors first nam'd and counted every star,
The Pleiads, Hyads, and the northern car.
Now snares for beasts and birds fell hunters place,
And wide surround with dogs the echoing chace ε 170
One, for the finny prey broad rivers beats,
One, from the sea drags ssow his loaded nets.
Erst did the woods the force of wedges feel,
Now saws were tooth’d, and temper'd was the steel 3
Then all those arts that polish life succeed ; 175
What cannot ceaseless ton, and preffing need Ι
Great Ceres first the plough to mortals brought,
To yoke the steer‚ to turn the furrow taught3
What time, nor mast, nor fruits the groves supply'd,
And fam'd Dodona sustenance deny’d ε 180}
Tillage grew toilsorne, the choak’d harvests dy'd 3

‘ Wants‚ fraudes, paffions‚ closer still ally
‘ The common int'rest, ancl endear the tye ς’

says the great moral poet in his Eſjizy on Man. And this doc-
trine is strongly illustrated throughout the whole system.
