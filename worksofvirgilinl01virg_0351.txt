*But nought will keep their vigour more entire5
Than from their breasts to turn the stings of blind defire:
Their bulls they banissi to some lonely scene,
Where vast rocks, and wide rivers intervene :
Or to the plenteous stall the beast remove, 280
Far from the tendet sex, and lure of love.
Fbr while the female eharms his fickening fight,
No more the groveS, or springing grass invite.
She vers’d in wanton looks, and winning wiles,
, The mighty rivals to the fight beguiles. ’ 285.
The beauteous heifer strays the darksome wood ;
With mutual rage they russ1 ς thick streams the sable blood ς
From their broad brows the classn‘ng horns rebound‚
5 With bellowings loud the grove's and ss<ies resound.
Nor, when the war is o'er, their tage expires; 29'0
To distant vales 'the vanquiih’d wretch retires 3
' We‘eps his disgrace, his conqu’ring rival's boa'st3
⁴ Yet more the fair, that unreveng'd he lost z
And oft with penfive looks, as he retreats‚
The parting exile views his ancient seats. 295
Then steels his limbs to toil, improves his nxight,
And roughly rests on craggy flints the night :
On prickly leaves and pointed rushes fed,
He feigns to gore a tree with butting head, ,
Bends his stern brows and puffles at the air, . 359,
And spurns the scatter'd saud, a prelude of the war.
Now when his nerves with new-felt fury glow,
Headlong he seeks his unexpecffing foe :
As when a rising billow by degrees‚ ⁷ 1
Begins to boil amid the whitening seas; 305

these beautiful strokes are concluded by the noble fimile of a
vast wave rolling towards a rocky ffiore. The pause'at pro·
