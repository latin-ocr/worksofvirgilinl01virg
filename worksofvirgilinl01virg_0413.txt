Book 4. THE Gaonorcs or-Vnton.. 377

At once she bids the swelling rivers cleave,
Th' obedient floods anpample entrance leave ;

Down thro' the deeps he goes, on either hand 4²5
The congregated waves like mousntains stand. ⁷

Now wondering at the wat'ry realms he went,

At dashing lakes in hollow caverns pent,

His mother’s palam, and the founding woods,

And deaf’ning roar of subterraneous floods. 430
Amaz’d he saw, this spacious globe below,

Deep in its bed each mighty river ssew,

Phasis, and Lycus, and the fruitful head, [spread3
Whence burst Enipeus' streams, whence father Tiber’s
whence Hypanis, that swiftly-fpouring roars 43 5
With thundering billows on his rocky shores 3

Whence Anio’s and Caicus’ copious urns,

Whence bull-fac'd Po adorn'd with gilded horns,

rivers of one country only, where he is expressly speaking of
all the rivers-t of the world ? and of one common point, from
whecrlrce all their sources were anciently supposed to be de.
rive ?

“ Ι am not quite clear as to that expreffion, replied Polymetis:
but to answer you as far as I can, I must give you the opinion
of a man whom you both know; and whose name Ι need not
mention to you, when Ι have told you it is the person who un-
det-stands Virgil in a more masterly manner, than perhaps any
one in this age, lt is his opinion, (with all that modesty, with
which he generally offers his opinions) that the difficulty you
mention may poffibly be got over, by the expreffion joined with
it ; per pinguia culta. The most violent rivers in the world are
such as run, or fall, through a chain of mountain53 and (not
to speak of any of the Apennine rivers, or rather torrents, in
Italy itself) the Isar which we cross so often in the two or three
last days journey before we enter Italy, is (in all that part of
its course) much more violent and more disturbed than the

' Po: but the Po, you know, very soon after its source, flows on

thro' the vale of Piedmont, and afterwards traverses all the
rich vale of Lombardy. These are the pinguia culta which
Virgil speaks of: almost the whole course of the Po is through
such rich low ground : and perhaps there may not be any river
in the world, which has almost all its course through so fat and
rich a soil, which is so violent as the Po is.'>’
