Book 3. THE GEOR—cxcs of Vnum, 325

So Rome's brave son-s, beneath th’ oppreffive load

Of arms and baggage, trace the destin'd road3 430
And while he ne'er suspessts th' impending blow,

'⁴ Sudden unfurl their standards on the foc.

Not so the Scythian shepherds tend their sheep 3

Where sad Moeotis spreads his sable deep3

Thick yellow sands where Ister's torrents roll, 435
And Rhodope returns to meet the pole.

Their flocks they stall 3 for o’er th' unfruitful scene,
Nor fields‚ nor trees are cloath’d In lively green.

One waste of snow the joylcss landscape lies,

Seven ells in height the ridgy drifts arise. 440
There still the bitter blasts of winter dwell;

Nor the sun’s mys the paly {hade dispe!‚

When first he climbs his noon-tide course, or laves

His headIOng car in ocean’s purple waves.

Th’ enci-oaching ice the loitering current feels, 445
And on its bosom bears the studded wheels ι ’
ῙΝὶιεῐε erst thelstately bari< was wont to ride,

VVaggons, ‘thro' paths unknown, securely gude,

Oft from the‘ veffel bursts the brazen band,

Stiff round their fides their frozen garments stand. 450
With ssaarpen'd steel they cleave the humid wine,

And chains of solid ice whole lakes confine 3

Their matted becinis, by the keen climate frore,

With hanging icicles are hard and hoar.

'has given us a nobie imitation of it, in his view of winter
within the polar circle3 and has added some striking circum-
stances, not to be, found in virgil, which modern travellers
have observed. Ι cannot forbear transcribing his conclusion,
where he describes winter personally. The image is sublime.

Here Winter holds his unrejoicing court,

'And thro' his airy han the loud misrule

Of driving tempest is for ever heard3

Here the grim tyrant meditates his wath,

Here ‘arms his winds with ali-subduing frost ς
Moulds his fierce hail, and treasures up his snows,
With which he now oppresses half the globe‚
