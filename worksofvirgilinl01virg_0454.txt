4& REFLECTIONS ON

In the beginning of the third book, which opens with
the praises of Epicurus, is a passage that of itself, 'with-
out alledging other instances‚ is sufficient to fhew the
:strength and sublimity of our author’s imagination. At
the found of thy voice (says he, addressing himself to
the father of his philosophy) the Terrors of the m'ind
(here personified) fly away with fear and astoniih-ment.

Namfimul ac ἦ» RATIO tua coepit vocg'fhrari
Naturam rerum haud divina mente coortam
Dffugiunt animi † TERRORES.

The walls of the world suddenly part asunder! I look
down into the immense void! and distinffly see all· it

contains !
-——- Moenia mundi

Discedunt, totum video per inane geri res.

This image always puts me in mind of that exalted οπο
in Milton, which is so -strongiy conceived.

On heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore

They view’d the vast immeafurable abyss

Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wssd,

Up from the bottom turn’d by furious winds

And surgi'ng waves, as mountains το affault

Heav'n's height, and with the center mix the pole.
Par· Lost, Β. vii· 210.

our poet· adds, in lines as finiihed anti as smooth as*
Virgil's, that he there saw the happy and undisturbed state
of the gods*

Apparet divum numen, sedesque quie'tae,

Quas neque concutiunt venti, neque nubila nimbis

Asper-gunt, neque nix acri concreta pruina

Cana cadens violat3 semperque innubilus aether

Integit‚ et larg? dzff'ufh lumine ridet .·---

At contra nusquam apparent Acherusia templa.

L. iii. 2 5«
