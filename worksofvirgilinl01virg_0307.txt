Book 2· THE GroRmcs OF Vmon„ ⁷ 273

Hence plenty every laughing vineyard fills,
Thro' the deep vallies and the ssoping hi11s3
vWhere-e'er the God inclines his lovely face,
More luscious·fruits the rich plantations grace.
Then let us Bacchus' praises duly sing, 475
And consecrated cakes, and chargers bring 3,
Dragg’d by their horns let viffim-goats expire,
And roast on hazel spits before the sacred fise.
ι Another toil in dreffing vines remains,
Unconquerable still by ceaseless pain33 480
Thrice and four times the soil, each rolling year,
The ponderous ploughs, and heavy drags must bear3
⁴3Leaves must be thinn⁷d : still following in a ring
The months fresh labours to the peasants bring.
Ev’n when the tree its last pale leaves hath med, 485
And Boreas stript the honours of its head,
To the next year the careful farmers look,
And form the plant with Saturn's bending hook.
Dig thou the first, and shoots superfluous burn,
And homeward first the vineyard's stakcs return 3 490
But, unbetray'd by too impatient haste,
To reap thy luscious vintage be the last.
’ Twice noxious weeds‚ twice made, o’er-run the land,
Whose rank increase requires the pruner's hand.
‘To larger vineyards praise or wonder yield, 495
But cultivate a small and manageable field.
Nor fail to cut the broorn and watery seed,
Ἴ And the wild willow of the graffy mead.
ἲ The vines now ty'd with many a strengthening band,
No more the culture of the knife demand. 500
Glad for his labour past and long employ‚
At the last rank the dreffer fings for joy !
