REFLECTIONS ΟΝ

Oblitusque hominem mirum fimat .· haud potis ignem3· ’ v
Excutere, invitum miratur se ire, rapique ‚
Praecipitem, te Phoebe vocans, te Phoebe frementem.
Vociferans, plenusque Deo, stimulisque subaHus α
Haud placidis 3 non ille dapum, non ille quietis,

Aut somni memor. hanc potis {³st deponere curam.

Whence ss10t this sudden flash that gilds the pole ἓ·
The god, the god comes ruihing on his s0u13

Fires with aethereal vigor every part,

Thro' ev‘ry trembling limb heseems to dart, ξ,
Works in each vein, and swells his rifing beart.
Deep in his breast the heav'nly tumult plays,

And sets his mounting spirits on a blaze.

Nor can the raging flames themselves contain,

For the whole god descends into the man.

. He quits mortality‚ and knows no bounde,

But fings inspir’d with more than human sounds.

Nor from his breast can-ihake th' immortal load²

But pants and raves impatient of the god ;

And, rapt beyond himself, admires the force

That drives him on reluctant to the course.

He calls on Phoebus*⁹ by the god opprest,

Who breathes exceffive spiritstn his breast ς

No force of thirst or hunger can controul

The fierce, the ruling trans port of his foul.

but are most of them applicable to every other species of
poctry. In his third and last book he hath treated of po-

etical style in general3 hath examined the force and, pro-

priety of every figure of speech with great accuracy and
true taste3 hath laid down some judicious rules, on that.
