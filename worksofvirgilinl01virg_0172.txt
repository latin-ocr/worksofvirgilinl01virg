Tum canit, errantem Permeffi ad flumina Gallum

Aonas in montis ut duxerit una sororum ; 65'
thue viro Phoebi chorus adsurrexerit omnis;

Ut Linus haec illi divino carmine pastor,

Floribus atque apio crinis ornatus amaro5

Dixerit, Hos tibi dant calamos (en accipe) Musae5 Α
Ascraeo quos ante seni : q'uibus ille solebat 76
Cantando rigidas deducere montibus ornos.·

His tibi Grynaei nemoris dicatur origo ε

Ne qui fit lucus5 quo se plusja&et Apollm

Qiid loquar ut Scyllam Nifi, aut quam fama secuta est3
Candida succinetam latrantibus inguina monstris 75
Dulichias vexaffe rates‚- et gurgite in alto

Ah timidos nautas canibus lacerasse marinis: ,

Aut ut mutatos Teri narraverit artus ?

Qas ille Philomela dapes, quae dona pararit? ’

⁴⁸ Qo cursu deserta petiverit, ct quibus ante 80²-
Infelix sua tecfta supervolitaverit alis?

' Omnia quac, Phoebo quondam meditante, beatuz

Audiit Eurotas, juffitque ediscere lauros,

Ille canit. pulsae referunt ad sidera valles.

Cogere donec ovis stabulis, numerumque referre 83
Juffit, et invito pro'ceffit Vesper Olympo.

88] When Virgil himself once entered the theatre, all the'
spe&ators rose up to honou'r his entrance.

89. Linus.] Vir-gil has been blamed very ridiculoussy for not
saying any thing of Homer in his fixth Aeneid (637. 6775)
where if he had said any thing of him, he must have put him
in Elysium before he was born. It seems more just to complain

that he has not mentioned him in all his works. He seems to' -

have had a fair opportunity here, and another in the fourth
Eclogue (v. 55.) But have not the poets he mentions in both
these places some relation to pastoral poetry? And might not
the mentioning of an epic poet be improper in both? Here he
§ames Linus only ς and before, the fame Lirim, Orpheus, arrd⁴
an. spanos.
