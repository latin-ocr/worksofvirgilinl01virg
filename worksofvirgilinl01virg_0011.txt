SIR,

CENSURE 13 so seldom sostened by apologie s,
that pe ”haps rt may be useless for me to de-
clare my consciousness of inability to do justice to

the most perfecst of poets, in the following» trans-
lation. When I first entered upon this work, Ι
sometimes imagined, that I heard the voice of
Virgil addreffing me with the humanity of his
hero3

‚Quo moriture ruis ? majoraque viribus audes ἕ
Fallit te incautum pietas tua!

 

for indeed nothing but my affeffion.for the author
could have engaged me in so arduous an under*
taking.

Whoever confiders the degree of delicacy and
Ἰ correc‘tness to which the Eclogues of Virgil are
polished3 together chh the ease and wonderful
harmony of his numbers3 will be convinced of
the extreme difficulty of transfufing into *another
