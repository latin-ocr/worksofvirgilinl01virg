sure owing to the rank of their authors, and to the age
in which they were written3 when criticism had not
spread so widely, nor was so well understood, as appa-

I am doubtful whether I ought to mention Ovm's
Art of Love in this list of didaffic poemS, from the li-

There is great dispute among the critics, whether
MAN1Lw's wrote his astronomica! poem in the age of Au-
gustus, as he himself affirms he did. Many instances of

the beauty and dignity of his language. See how he
hath described a bloomlng and beautiful youth, labohring
under this dreadful distemper2
