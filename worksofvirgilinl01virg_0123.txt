Ecl. 2. -THE Ecroomzs or Vmcn„ ” 93⁰

Befides, two dappled kids, which late I found

Deep in a dale with dangerous rocks around, .

For thee I nurse3 with these, O corne and play !

They drain two swelling udders every day. 50
These Thestylis hath begg'd‚ but begg'd in vain 3

Now be they her's, since you my gifts disdain.

Corne, beauteous boy! the nymphs in baskets bring

For thee the loveliest linies 0f the spring3

Behold for thee the neighb’ring Naiad crops 55
The violet pale, and poppy's fragrant top3‚

Narciffus' buds she joins with sweet jonquils‚

And mingles cinnamon with daffodils 3

With tender hyacinths of darker dyes,

3The yellow marigold diverfifies. ³ 60
gThee‚ with the downy quince, and chesnuts sweet,
{Which once my Amaryllis lov'd, I'll greet5

}To gather plumbs of gloss'y hue, will toil 3

*These shall be honour'd if they gain thy smile.

'Ye myrtles too I'll crop and verdant bays, 65
jFor each, so plac’d, a richer scent conveys.

O Corydon, a rustic hind thou art Ι

¹Thy presents ne'er will touch Alexis’ heart !

,Give all thou canst, exhaust thy rural store,

[Iolas‚ thy rich rival, offers more. ⁴ 70
lWhat have I spoke ? betray'd by heedless thought,
{The boar into my crystal springs hav‘e brought!

60. Marigold] Dr. Martyn has taken great pains to explain
the true names of the fiowers here mentioned by virgil, and from
his sszill in botany one may imagine he has justly ascertained
them. I follow him.

61. Chesnuts sweet.] There are still in Italy, garlands in-
termixt with fruits as well as flowers, like that described by
virgil in his Eclogues. Ι have seen some of these carried
about the streets of Florence, the sunday before Christmas·
day: They were built up in a pyramid of ever-greens‚ chiefly

of bays, and faced with apples, grapes‚ and other fruits.

71. What.] This reading is after the Va‘tican manuscript.
