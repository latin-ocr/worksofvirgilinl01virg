ECLOGUE THE SEVENTH.

ARGUMENT.

:The following poetical contest betwixt Thyrfis and Corydon,

related by stdeliboeus, is an imitation of the fifth and eighth ἶ
Idylliums of Theocritus. Some fanciful commentators ima· Ι
gine that under these fhepherds are represented Gallus or
Pollio, or Cebes and Alexander, and that Meliboeus is Vir-
gil himself. But there are not sufficient grounds for this
conjetture. This pastoral is introduced with a pretty rural
adventure. Δ

This seventh Eclogue‚ as the third before, seems to be an
imitation os a cuslom among the fhepherds os old, of vying
together in extempore verse. At least 'tis very lilse the {m-
provisa‘cori at J‘Jrescnt in Italy 3 whoflourish now perhaps more
than any other peets among them, particularly in Tuscany·

. They are surprifingly ready in their answers (respondere

parati) ancl go on 0&avefhr ostense, or speech for speech
alternately (alternis dicetis, amant alterna Camenae.)

In both these Eclogues the second speaker seems obliged to

. follow the turn of thought used by the jis-st 3 as at present

Ι 5

the second Improvisatore is obliged to follow the rhyme of
the fiist At Florence I have heard of their having even
Improxiiso comedies. There were Improvisatori of this
kind of old3 for before Livius Andronicus endeavoured to
make any thing· of a regular play, composstum temer& ae
rudem alternis jaciebant, says Livy, 7. 2. U. C. 391.

They were ‘sustam too who brought this method to Rome.
