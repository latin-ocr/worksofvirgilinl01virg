DIDAcr1c POETRY. 431

Green rise the Kentilh hills in chearful air ς
But on the marihy plains that Effex spreads ἲ
Build not, nor rest too long thy wand'ring feet·
For on a rustic throne of dewy ,τω-ἶ,

With baneful fogs her aching temples bound,
Quartana there prefide33 a meagre fiend

Begot by Eurus, when his brutal force
Compress’d the ssothful Naiads of the fens.

B. i. 108.

In how lofty a manner hath he introduced his precepta
concerning drinking water Ξ

l

Now come, ye Naiads, to the fountains lead ἰ
Now let me wander through your gelid reign 3

I turn to view th’ enthufiastic wilds

By mortal elf untrod. I hear the din

Of waters thundering o’er the ruin’d cliffs.

With holy reverence I approach the rocks
'VVhence glide the streams renown’d in ancient song.
Hence from the desart down the rumbling steep
First springs the Nile 3 here bursts the founding Po
In angry waves3 Euphrates hence devolves

A mighty flood to water half the East;

And there in Gothic solitude reclin'd
The chearless Tanais pours his hoary urn-

What solemn twilight ! what stupendous shades
Enwrap these infant floods ! Thro’ every nerve

A sacred horror thrills 3 a pleafing fear

Glides o'er my frame ! B. ii. 352, &c-

In stiort, this author hath evidently 1hewn, that there
is no subject but what is capable of being exalted into
poetry by a genius.

There is a sublimity of sentiment ἕ, an energy of
diction,

⁴² See particularly Ep. i. ver. 267 to the end. If there be

&ny fault in this poem, it is perhaps the mixing droll and

burlesque
