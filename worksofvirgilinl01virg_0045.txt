THE LIFE OF VIRGIL. 15

And now being in his 34th year, he retired to a de·
lightful and convenient privacy at Naples, and laid the
plan of his inimitable Georgics: which he undertook at
the earnest entreaties of that wise and able minister,
Maecenas : not to rival and excel Hefi0d‚ whom he has
but little imitated, as he had lately done Theocritus,
but on a noble political motive, and to promote the wel-
fare of his country. Great was the desolation occasioned
by the continuance and cruelty of the civil wars : Italy
was almost depopulated; the lands were uncultivated
and unstocked3 a famine and insurrection ensued3 Au-
gustus himself hardly escaped being stoned by the en-
raged populace, who attributed this calamity to his am-
bition. This best and wisest minister therefore, Nlaece-
nas, resolved if poffible to revive the decayed spirit of
husbandry3 to introduce a taste for cultivation3 to
make rural improvements a falhionable amusement of the
great. What method so likely to effe& this, as to re-
commend agriculture with all the infinuating charms of
poetry? Virgil fully answered the expeC’mtions of his
polite patr0n3 for the Georgics contain all those mas-
terly beauties that might be expee'ced from an exalted
genius, whose judgment and imagination were in full
vigour and maturity, and who had leisure to give the last
polish and perfe&ion to his incomparable workmanship.

As to Maecenas's character, tho' a bad writer himself,
fond of far-fetch’d metaphors and an affeeted stile, yet
was he indisputably the kindcst patron the Muses ever
found, in any age or country. Paterculus has given us
a portrait of him, painted with his usual elegance and
expreffiveness. Urbis czstodiis praeposttus C. stffaecenas,
