As when the-Perfian tyrant‚';foil’d and stung

With fixame and desperation‚ gnaih’d his teeth

To see thee rend the pageants of his throne3

And at the lightning of thy lifted spem· ’

Crouch'd like a ssave. Bring all thy martial spoils,

Thypalms, thy laureis, thy triumphant songs,

Thy smiling band of ans, thy godlike firCS

Of civil wisdom, thy heroic youth

Warm, frdm the schools of giory. Guide vmy way

Thro' fair Lyceum's walk‚ the green retreats

Of Academus, and the thymy vale,

Where oft enchanted with⁴ Socratic sounds,

Ilissus pure devolv’d his tuneful stream

”In gentler mu-rmurs. From the blooming store

Of' these auspicious fields, may I unblam'd

Transplant some living bloffoms, to adorn ’Ξ

My native clime : while far above the flight

Of fancy's plume aspiring, I unlock

The springs of ancient wisdom3 while I join

Thy name, thrice honour'd ἔ with th’ immortal praise

Of nature ; while to my compatriot yonth

I point the high example of thy sonS,

And tune to Attic themes the Britssish lyre. ,
Book i. ver, 567.
