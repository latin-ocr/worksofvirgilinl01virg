Bruis'd baum, and vulgar cerinth spread around,

And ring the tinkling brass, and sacred cymbals found:

They'll settle on the medicated seats‚

And hide them in the chambers' last retreats. 80
But if intent on war they seek the foe,

'Twixt two contending kings when discords glow‚

The peoples' troubled minds you soon? presage,

Burning for battle, swoln with eager rage3

Hark ! a rough clangor calls the hosts to arms, 85

A voice, like the deep trumpet’s hoarse alarms !

Furious they meet, and brandiihing their wings,

Fit all their claws, and lharpen all their stings 3

Around their monarch's high pavilion crowd,

And call the lagging foe with [houtings loud. 9·

Now when a day serene and bright they gain,

From the vext city rusti both battles main ;

Dire is the conflict, loud resounds the sky,

Close in one cluster they contend on high,

And headlong fall, as thick as clattering hail, 95

Or acorns strew, from shaken oaks, the vale.

The kings ssiine glorious 'mid the thickest war,

And mighty souls in narrow bosoms bear:

Stedfast in fight, unknowing how to yield,

Till these or those forsake the deathful field. 100

78. Cymbals.] Tinm'tusque cie, &c. This custom is still used.
Aristotle mentions it likewise, and questions whether they hear
or not, and whether it be delight or fear that causes the bees
to be quieted with such noises. For my own part I believe it
to be of no manner of service in this case. MARTYN.

85. Hosts to arms.] This battle is described with as much
spirit and strength, and the fury of the combatants is painted
in terms as bold and majestic, as if it were an engagement
between the greatest heroes. One cannot but observe how
virgil exalts his bees by giving them all the warlike appa-
ratus of an army. Such are the expressions<
Aeris rauci canor, spicula, and praetoria, magmsque ‘vocant
clamoribus hostem, per medias acies, erumpunt portis
concurmtur.
