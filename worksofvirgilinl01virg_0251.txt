Book 1. THE Gnoncxcs OF V1RG11.. 217

Olympus ffiagg'd with woods ; th' almighty fire
Thrice dash’d the mountains down with forky fire. 340
Next to the tenth, the seventh to luck inclines,
For taming 4οΧεῑΓι, and for planting vines 3
Then best her woof the prudent housewife weaves3
Better for ssight the ninth‚ adverse to thieves.
Ev'n in cold night some proper tasks pursue, 345
Or when gay morn impearls the field with dew3
At night dry stubble, and parcht meadows mow,
At night, fat moisture never fails to flow ;
One, by the glowing ember’s livid light,
Watches and works the livelong winter's night, 350
Forms spiky torches with his ssmrpen’d knife 3
⁸ Mean-while with equal industry his wife,
Beguiling time fings in the glimmering room,
To chear the labours of the rattling loom5
Or on the luscious must while bubbles rise, 355
With leaves the trembling cauldron purifies.
But cut the golden corn in mid-day's beat,
And the parcht grain at noon's high ardor beat.
Plough naked ; naked sow 3 the busy lund
No'rest but in bleak wintry hours can find ; 360
In that drear season‚ swains their stores enj oy,
Mirth all their thought, and feasting their employ5
'The genial time to mutual joy excites,
And drowns their cares in innocent delights.
As when a freighted ship has touch'd the port, 365
The jovial crews upon their decks reson,
With fragrant garlands all their sterns are crown’d,
And jocund strains from {hip to ship resound.
Yet then from leafless oaks their acorns strip,
From bays and myrtles bloody berries ssip, 37⁸
For noxious cranes then plant the guileful snare,
. O’er tainted ground pursue the listening hare 3
Pitch toyls for stags, and whirling round the string‚
