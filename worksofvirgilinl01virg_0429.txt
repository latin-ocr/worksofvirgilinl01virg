Book 4. Tm: GE‘oRmcs οἳ Vnum.. 393

At the ninth morning’s dawn to Orpheus bears
Th' appointed gists, and to the grove repairs ε 660
When lo ! a wond’rous prodigy they found,
An host of oees russl'd forth with humming sound,
By the ssain bullocks' putrid bowels form’d,
From whose burst fides, in clouds immense they swarm'd 3
Then from a tree's high top, conglob’d depend, 665
Whose branches with the bellying cluster bend.

Thus have I sung the labours of the swain,
Of trees, of flocks, of cattle, and of grain3
While mighty Caesar to Euphrates bears
His conquering arms, the thunder of his wars ς 67.
To all the willing world new laws decrees 3
And ardent preffes on, th' Olympian heights to seize,
Then me, Barthenope's calm pleasures blest‚
And studious leisurc and ignoble rest ;
Who bold in youth, once sung the shepherds loves, 67 5
Sung thee, O TityruS, stretcht beneath the beechen groves.

673. Then me.] I cannot forbear being of opinion that the
four concluding lines of the GeorgicS, illo Virgilium, διε. &c-
are of the same stamp and character with the four justly-ex-
ploded ones, which ase prefixed to the Aeneid. Audaxque
juventa is, Ι think, an expreffion entirely unworthy of Virgil,
and a mere botch. Befides nothing can be a more complete
and sublime conclufion than that compliment to Augustus
—Viamque affiliat OlympO.

676. Graves] Each book of Virgil’s Georgics is in a diffe-
rent stile (or has a different colouring) from all the rest. That
of the first is plain3 of the second ‘various ς of the third, grand ς
and of the fourth pleastng. Honnswoaru.
