⁷ Book 2- THE GEoRmcs οἳ Vnum„ 269

When cattle first o'er new-born mountains spread,
And man, an iron race, uprear’d his hardy head :
When beasts thro' pathless brakes began to prowl‚
And glittering stars thro’ heav’n’s blue concave roll. 415
Nor could this infant world sustain th’ extremes
Of piercing winter, and hot Sirius' beams,
Did not kind Heav’n, the fier-ce excess between,
Bid gentler spring's soft season intervene.

Now, when you bend the layers to the ground, 420
Cast fatt'ning dung and copious mold around3
Or near the roots rough stiells and pebbles hide,
Thro' which the fostering rains may gently glide3
Thro' which may subtle vapours penetrate,
And to large growth the tendrils instigate. 425
There are, with weights of stone who press the roots,
Best safeguard to the plants‚ and future frusts,
Both in immoderate mowers, or summer's hear,
Vshen Sirius' beams on the parcht vineyard beat.
About the roots oft turn the neighb’ring soil, 430
And urge the drag and hough with frequent toil;
Or introduce thy plough's unwieldy load,
And 'twixt thy vines the struggling bullocks goad.
Then the smooth cane, the forky ash prepare,

Auxiliar pole, and strong supporting spear ; 435
Affisted thus, the lusty plants despise

The {hattering whirlwinds‚ and the stormy skies, }
And to the tall elm’s top by just gradations rise.

The new-born buds, the tender foliage spare3
The stxoots that vigorous dart into the air, 440

436. Afflsted thus] The word tabulata in the original fig-
nifies the branches of elms extended at proper distances to sus-
tain the vines.

440. Dart into the ain] The original says, laxis perpurum
immg‘ffics habenis.- this expreffion is doubtless extremely bold
and* strong, but the poet had the authority of his master Lu=
cretius.

Crescendi magnum immzffi‘s certamen habenis.
