of polite literature and just criticism. His Poetics have
been always deservedly read and admired as a fine didae’tic
poem, and confidering the time in which he wrote, were
of great use in diffufing a good taste among his country-

panegyric he ever received was from Mr. Pope in the

and an absence of the poetic inclination ε

Vis fizevit, totoque agitat se corpore numen.
Ille autem exultans jaciat jam non fita verba,
