¹ Muses from mighty Jove begin the theme;
With mighty J0ve all nature’ s regions teem.
Ι <With liberal hand he sows the plenteous plains,
Ι Nor unpropitious hears my rural strains. - 80

ἲ E'en me, mean ffiepherd, Phoebus deigns to love,
Sacred to him Ι rear a laurel-grove:
And still along my laviffi borders rise, .
Ῐ His hyacinths of sweetly-blooming dies.

At me an apple Galatea threw‚ 85
Then to the willows‚ wily girl, withdrew3
‹ Yet as with hasty steps {he skimm’d the green,
’. Wiss1'd, ere she gain'd the willow8, to be seen.
’ MENALCAS.
' But unsolicited Amyntas burns
For me, spontaneoussy my love returns 3 90
Unask’d the boy prevents each soft request‚
Nor by my dogs is Delia more caress'd.

DAMOETAS.
To the dear Venus of my love-fick mind,

Her swain a welcome present has defign’d.

I mark’d the bough where two fond turtles coo’d, 95
And her’s shall be the nest, and feathery brood.
MENALcAs.

 

Amid the woodland wilds a tree I found,

Its plenteous boughs with golden apples crown'd ;

Then, all 1 could, to my dear youth I sent,

And mean ten more to—rnorrow to present. 100
DAMoETAs.

How oft with words so mufically mild,

Has Galatea every sense beguil'd !

Some part, at least, to heav’n, ye breezes, bear,

Nor let such words be lost in common air.
