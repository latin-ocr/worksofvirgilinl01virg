Ecl. 4. THE EcLooUEs OF Vmon„ 117

Each field shall breathe Assyria’s rich perfume,

And sweets ambrofial round thy cradle bloom :

With milk o'ercharg’d the goats shall homeward speed, 25

And herds secure from mighty lions feed.

The baleful asp and speckled snake shall die,

Nor pois'nous herb 'mid flow’rs conceal’d shall lie.

But when his matchless father’s deeds divine,

And how in virtue’s arduous paths to shine, 30

Warm’d with old heroes’ fame, the youth shall know,

· Then clustering grapes on forest-thorus shall glow 3

Swains without culture golden harvests reap,

And knotted oaks shall showers of honey weep.

Yet of old crimes some footsteps shall remain, 35

The glebe be plough’d‚ ships tempt the dang'rous main3

'Round citios bulwarks rise, and maffy tow'rs,

And other Argo's bear the chosen pow’rs ;

New wars the bleeding nations shall destroy, ‘¹

And great Achilles find a second Troy. ⁵ 40
Last, when he reaches manhood’s prime complete,

The sailor shall forsake the useless fleet ;

No freighted ship shall wandel· ocean ’round,

With ev’ry fruit shall ev’ry clime be crown’d z

No lands shall feel the rake, nor vine the hook, 45

The swain from toil his bullocks shall unyoke:

No wool shall glow with alien colours gay,

The ram himself rich fleeces shall display

shall spring up spontaneoussy‚ and grow ripe with soft and
tender beards.

38. Argo’s.] By navigation and commerce Vix-gil means
that avarice, and by warS‚ that ambition shall still subfist.

39. Wars.] A bloody war at last reduced Sextusssssfnnggo

quit Sicily, and meet his death in Asia by Anthony. The
conjunfture of affairs, the preparations made by Ozffiavian, and
above all, the dispofitions of men's minds, gave room for the

predistion of the poet, C Α τ R o υ .
