Book 3. Tm· Gssonmcs or Vmon„ 309

And drive them from the browze and cooling flood,
When now the new defires invade the boiling blood:

Ost bid them glow beneath the sunny ray,

And oft fatigue them thro' the dusty way τ ,
When groan the floors beneath the trampled corn, 185
And light in air the ssuttering chaff is borne ς

Lest too luxurious ease and plenty eloy,

Blunt the keen sense, and choak the paths of joy :
So {hall the female feel the flowing seed,

But to the mares deny they fostering food, 180}

And suck with greedy rage the rulhing steed. 190
We now forsake the fires, transfer our care,

From the stout stallion‚ to the teeming mare.

Let her no more, along the lab'ring ground,

Draw the ssow car, or leap the rifing mound:

Nor tempt the fl00d‚ nor skim the level mead, 195}
But turn her lonesome in the lawns to seed,
Soft with the greenest grass, and many a mossy bed ;

Where some full river rolls his plenteous waves,

Mid’ {hades of ridgy rocks, and cooling caves.

Along the forests dark where Selo flows, 200
And old Alburnus lifts his ilex-crowned brows,

Of winged inse&s swarms a frequent ssight,

Aestron in Greece; at Rome Afilus hight;

Soon as their iffuing hosts, with humming sound
Approach, the cattle quit the groves around 3 205
The skies re-echo to the mingling roar,

The groves, and dry Tanager’s sultry shore I

As when a swarme of gnats, at evendde,
Out of the sennes of Allan doe arise,
Their murmuring small trumpets sounden wide,
Whiles in the air their clustering armie flies,
That as a cloud doth seeme to din the fiziesg
Ne man nor beast may rest, or take repast,
For their {harpe wounds‚ and noyous injuriesz
’Till the fierce northern wind with blustring blast
Doth blowne them quite away, and in the ocean cast.
