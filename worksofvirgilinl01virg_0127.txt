ECLOGUE THE THIRD.

ARGUMENT.

This Eclogue contains a dzspute between two shepherds, of that
sort which the critics call Amoebaea, from Ap-ouCoews, mutual
or alternate. In this way of writing the perfins are re-
prefi’nted tospeak alternately, the latter always endeavour-
ing to exceed, or at least equal, what has been said by the
former, in the very same number os verse53 in which if he
falls, he loses the viHory. Here Menalcas and Damoetas
reproach each other, and then fing for a wager, making
Palaemon judge between them. Menalcas begins the con-
tention, by tasting some reflebiions on his rival Aegon, and
hisfi’rvvnt Damoetas· Vives, as usual, endeavours to ,al-

· legorize this Eclogue, and says that Virgil means himself
under the fiditious name of Damoetas. I heard, says Mr.
Holasl'worth, a poetical contest of this kind at V al-Ombrofa,
which being very satirical, put me in mind of the old
Bucolics.
