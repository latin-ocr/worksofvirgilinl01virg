And late at eve returning home to rest,
His frugal board with unbought dainties blest, 160}
Nor wish’d to be the richest monarch’s guest. ,
When spring with flowers, with fruits when autumn
He first could pull the apple‚ crop the rose 3 [glows,
When winter drear had clove the rocks with cold,
‘And chain'd in ice the rivers as they roll'd, 165
Ev'n then acanthus’ tendet leaves he shear’d‚
Slow zephyr blam’d‚ and a late summer fear’d.
He the first swarms could boast and pregnant bees,
From the full combs could richest honey squeeze : }
Tall were his pines and limes, and fruitful all his trees.
whatever buds the bending branches wore, 171
So many fruits in autumn swell'd his stote.
He too could high-grown elms transplant in tows,
Or harden'd pear-trees from their place transpose,
Or plumbs with all their fruits, or lofty planes 175
That shelter'd with broad shades the quaffing swains.
But smee too narrow bounds my song confine,
To future bards these subje&s I resign.

Now listen while the wond’rous powers I fing,
And genius giv’n to bees by heav'n’s almighty king, 180
VVhom in the Cretan cave they kindly fed,
By cymbals’ sound, and clashing armour led.
They, they alone a general interest share,
Their young committing to the public care 3

Admiranda tibi ›le-vium speffacula rerum.

You will soon see to whom the wonders are applicable‚ which
I relate of these little creatures. How fine a compliment was
it to the Roman people‚ and their prince, to shew that the bees
had their laws (upon which all their happiness was founded)
by inspiration from Jupiter, and their prince from the samq
source! Bnusou.

180. King.] The poet here infinuates, that Jupiter gave the
bees a degree of reason, as a reward for their feeding him,
when au infant, with honey, while he was concealed in a cave
from this father saturn.
