in proportion to her length : in the other bees, they cover the
whole body ; in her they terminate about half way, at the
third ring of her trunk. ‚She has, like the rest, a sting and
bladder of poison; but is with much more difficulty provoked
to use them3 though when she does, the wound is larger and
much more painful.

The drones, or the thousand husbands of this single queen,
a're found in the hive only from the beginning of May to the
end of July. Their number increases every day during that
space of time, and is greatest when the queen is breeding';
in a few days after which period they? die a violent death.
Their way of living is' very different from the rest : for except-
ing the single moment when they pay their duty to the queen,
they are quite idle, and enjoy a most luxurious fare3 being
fed only with the finest honey, whereas the common bees live
in a great measure upon wax. These go out early in the
morning, and don't return till they are loaded with honey and
wax, for the good of the society. The drones, on the con-
trary, don't go abroad till about eleven o'clock to take the
air, and return punc‘tmssy about fix at night. They· have no
stings, nor those long elastic teeth wib. which the ozher bees
work up the honey3 nor those kind oi hollows. 'which serve
them for baskets to bring it horne to the 1222. 'i he other
bees, or the manufaffurers (as we may call them) 'nave an infi-
nite number of strange particula-sities about them, of which
we can only impart a few to the reader.

Their head seems triangular, and the point of the· triangle
is formed by the meeting of two long eiastic werin, which are
concave on the infide. In the second and third. pair of their
legs, is apart called the brasii, os a square figzre, with its
outward furface poliffi’d and ssoek, and its inward hniry, like
acommon brusn. With these two instruments they prepare
their wax and honey. The materiale· of their wax lie in the
form of dust, upon the lamina of fiowers. When the hee
would gather this dust, she enters into the flomer, and takes it
up by means of her brush, to which it easily adhe-res. She
comes out all covered with it, sometimes yellow, sometimes
red, or according to the native colour of the dust. ischis dust
be inclosed in the Capsulae of a flower, she pierces the Cafy'ia'ae,
with her long moveable teeth, and then she gathers iti When
it is quite loaded with dust, she rubs herself to colle& it, and
rolls it up in a little mass. Sometimes she performs this part
'of her business by the way ; sometimes she stays till she comes
to the hive. As soon as it is formed into a 'oall about the fize
of a grain of pepper, she lodges it in her balket‚ ane retmns
home with a joy proportionable to the quantity she brings. The
honey of the bees is found¹ in the same place with the wax, lt
is lodged in little reservoirs, placed at the bottom of the nowen-0
