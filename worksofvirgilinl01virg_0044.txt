η, THE Lim: or VIRGIL.
——Quibus ille solebat

Cantando rigidas deducere montibu& ornos.

Gallus was greatly beloved by Augustus, who advaneed “ Γ

him from a low condition into the highest posts. But be-
ing afterwards made governor of Egypt, he fell into a
debauched and luxurious life, abused the emperor in his
cups, and eree-ed statues of himself throughout the pro-
vince3 for which, and other misdemeanors, beingbanish-
ed by Augustus, he fell upon his own swerd, in an agony
of grief and despair. Donatus relates that Virgil was so
fond of this Gallus, that the fourth Georgic‚ from the
middle to the end, was filled with his praises3 and that
he afterwards changed this part into the story of Aristaeus,
at the command of Augustus. But Ruaeus justly questions
the truth of this story. He observes that the story of
Aristaeus is so well connected with the culture of the
’ bees, that it does not seem to have been stuck in, but to
rise naturally from the subject, and to have been a first
thought 3 that it is not probable, that Virgil would be,-
stow so large a part of his work in the praise of Gallus,
when he had given but a few lines· to Maecenas himself,

to whom he dedicated the whole poem : and lastly, that q ¹

Augustus himself, according to Suetonius, lamented the
death of Gallus3 and therefore cannot be thought so
injurious to his memory, as to envy him some empty
praise.

Thus we see virgil employed the very earliest efforts of
his muse, at a time, in other poets,

W'hen pure description holds the place of sense,

to uses-ul and prudent purposes, to conciliate the coun- - '

tcnance of the great, to relieve the distresscs of himself
and his family, to commemorate his benefafflrs, to gain
the favour and friendship of those by whom itwas honour
and happiness to bc beloved.
