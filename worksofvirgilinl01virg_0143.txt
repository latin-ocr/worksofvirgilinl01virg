‘ECLOGUE THE FOURTH.

ARGUMENT.

Catrou seems to be the first commentator that has given any
thing like a rational interpretation of the subject of this
samous Eclogue. His words are as follows, viz. In the
year of Rome 714, says he, when Asinius Pollio and Do-
mitius Calvinus were consuls, the people of Rome compelled
the triumvirs Octavian and Anthony to make a durable
peace between them. It was hoped‚ that thereby an end
would be put to the war with Sextus Pompey, who had
made himself mester of Sicily, and by the interruption of
commerce‚ had caused a famine in Rome. To make this
peace the more firm, they would have Anthony‚ whose wife
Fulvia was then dead, to marry Ona-vion Caesar-’s sfier
Octavia, who had lately [cst her husband Marcellus, ancl
was then big with a child, of which she was delivered
a ter her marriage with Anthony. This child retained the
name of his own father Marcellus, and as long as he lived
was the delight of his uncle Obtavian, and the hope of the
Roman people. It is he that is the subject of this Eclegzce.
Virgil addi-effis it to Polli0‚ ‘coho was at that time consul,
ancl thereby makes a compliment to Caesar, Anthony‚ Oc-
tavia, and Pollio, all at once. The Marcellus, whose
birth is here celebrated, is the same whose death is lomentecl

λ hy Virgil in the fixth Aeneid. The poet borrows what

was predicted by the Camaean Sybil concerning Jesus

Christ, and applies it to this child.
