Palmes agit, laxis per purum inmiffus habenis,

Ipsa acies nondum falcis tentandag sed uncis 363
Carpendae manibus frondes, interque legendae.—

Inde ubi jam validis amplexae stirpibus ulmos

Exierint, tum stringe comas, tum brachia tondes

Ante reformidant ferrum: tum denique dura
Exerce imperia, et ramos conpesce fluentis. 376
, Texendae sepes etiarn, et pecus omne tenendum:
-Praecipue durn frons tenera inprudensque laborum τ

Cui, super indignas hiemes solemque potentem,
Silvestres uri assidue capreaeque sequaces

Inludunt : pascuntur oves avidaeque juvencae. 375
Frigora nec tantum cana concreta pruina,-

Aut gravis incumbens scopulis arentibus aestus,
Quantum illi nocuere greges, durique venenum

Dentis, et admorso signata in stirpe cicatrix.

Non aliam ob eulpam Baccho caper omnibus aris 380
Caeditur, et veteres ineunt proscenia ludi :

Praemiaque ingeniis pagos et compita circum

Thesidae posuere, atque inter pocula laeti

Mollibus in pratis unAEtos saliere per utres.

Nec non Ausonii, Troja gens missa,- coloni 385
Versibus incomtis ludunt, risuque solut03

Oraque corticibus sumunt horrenda cavatis:

Et te, Bacche, vocant per carmina laeta, tibique

Oscilla ex alta suspendunt mollia pinu.

semicircular building, appropriated to the affing of plays, the
name being derived from θεαομιιι to behold. lt was divided
into the following parts. 1. The porticus, scalae, sedilia;
the rows of sedilia, or scats, were called canet, because they
were formed like wedges, growing narrower, as they· carne
nearer the center of the theatre; and these were all d1sp0sed
about the circumference of the theatre. 2. The orchestra, so
called from ορχεισθαι to dance : it was the inner part, or center ¹
of the theatre, and the lowest of all, and hollow‚ whence the
whole open space of the theatre was called cavea. Here sat
the senators, and here were the dancers and music. 3- The
