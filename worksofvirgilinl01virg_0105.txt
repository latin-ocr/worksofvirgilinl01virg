ECLOGUE THE FIRST.

ARGUMENT:

Γο reward the veteran soldiers that conquered Brutus and
Cafflus at the battle of Philippi, Augzfius distributed
amongst them the lands of Cremona and ·Mantua : Virgil’s
estate was seized among the rest, but he recovered it by the
interest of Pollio, who warmly recommended him to the
emperor. This Eclogue was written on this occasion out
of gratitude to Augzgstus. Some commentators, fond ff
allegorical ‘interpretations‚ imagine that by the names of
the two mistrcffis Amaryllis and Galatea, are meant Rome
and Mantua3 but this interpretation cannot jzfstly be sup-
ported. It has been conjet‘tured, that Virgil infinuates
his old mistreſs Galatea was of Brutus’s party 3 and his
new one Amaryllis of Oaavius's 3 and that by changing
mistrffs he hints at his changing partie53 and in conse·
qzaeence of that, at his leaving Mantua, and going ta
Rome.
