DJDACTIC POETRY. 4¹9

On the perusal of this paffage, can one forbear crying
out with the author ?

His tibi me rebus, quaedam divina voluptas
Percipit atque horror l

The descriptions of a person in a deep lethargy‚ lib. iii.
'ver- 4653 of the effests of drunkenness‚ ver. 4753 of
the falling sickness, ver. 486 3 and the noble prosopopoeia,
ver. 944, where Nature is introduced chiding her un-
grateful sons for their folly and discontentg are equal to
any thing in the Roman poesy 3 as is likewise the con-
clusion of this book, where the poet allegorizes all the
punishments of hell, from ver. 991 to 1036. ’Tis hard
to determine whether the poetry or impiety of this third
book (where many weak arguments are brought against
the immortality of the foul) be greatest.

In the fourth book our author hath painted the evils
and inconveniences attending the paffion of love in the
liveliest terms. No poet seems to have felt more strongly
than Lucretius. For this see the following description
of jealousy‚ and observe the minute circumstances it
enumerates.

Aut quod in ambiguo verbum jaculata reliquit,
..Quod cupido adfixum cordi vivescit ut ignis 3
Aut nimium jac‘lare oculos, aliumve tueri
Quod putat, in vultuque videt vqstigia risds.
L. iv. ¹13¹0

I know not what apology to make to the reader for
such a number of quotations : but I have always thought
that general crificism, without producing particular pas-
sageS‚ was both useless and unentertaining. Befides, I
look upon the giving him these descripfions, to be like
leading him through a gallery adorned with the most ex-
quifite paintings. I am sure there is no piece by the
hand of Guido or Carrache, that exceeds the following

groupe of allegorica} personages.
