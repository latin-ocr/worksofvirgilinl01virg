He strikes vast Rhodope’s exalted crown, 400
And hurls huge Athos, and Ceraunia down.
Thick fall the rains; the wind redoubled roars 3 [shores.
The God now smites the woods, and now the founding
Warn’d by these ills, observe the starry signs,
Whither cold Saturn's joyless orb inclinoe, 405
Whither light Hermes' wanderIng flama is driv’n.
First to the Gods be all due honours giv'n3
To Ceres chief her annual rites be paid,
On the green turf, beneath a fragrant ssiade, γ
When winter ends, and spring serenely sinnas, 410
Then fat the lambs, then mellow are the wines,
Then sweet are numbers on the flowery ground,
Then with thick shades are lofty mountains crown’d.
Let all thy hinds bend low at Ceres’ shrine 3
Mix honey sweet‚ for her, with milk and mellow wine ;
Thrice lead the vifiim the new fruits around, 416
And Ceres call, and choral hymns resound :
Presume not, swains, the ripen'd grain to reap,
Till crown'd with oak in antic dance ye leap,
'Invoking Ceres, and in solemn lays, 420
Exalt your rural queen’s immortal praise.

Great Jove himself unerring signs ordains,
Of chilling winds, and heats, and driving rains ς
The moon declares when blust'ring Auster faiis,
When herds should be confin’d near shelt'ring stalls.
When winds approach, the vex’d sea heaves around, 426
From the bleak mountain comes a hollow found,

427. Mountain.] This puts me in mind of a‘paffage in Thom-
son's Seasons on the same subjeet, the approach of a storm z

Along the woodS, along the moorish fens,
Sighs the sad genius of the coming stoi-1113
And up among the loose disjointed ciiffs,
And fraaur’d mountains wild, the brawling brool<
And cave presageful send a hollow moan,
Resonnding long ivn listening fancy’s ear.
Tuomsox’s Winter‚ ver. 70.
