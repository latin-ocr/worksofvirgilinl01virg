ADVERTffiEMENT: xix·

lestionss Inutst not neglec‘? to return my thanks to Mra-
Warburion‚ for giving leave thot his most learned and ,
ingenious differtation on the sixth book of 'the AEneid
might be here inserted ; which the render will find
much altered and enlczrged with several valzcoble addi-
tions. Mr. William Whiteheod heth contrihuted to'
⁷ the usefulness and beanty of this work by giving it
what V irgil has long wanted, cz destgn for the fhield of
AEneas. He hath added a differtation on this subjeci,
wherein are some carious remarks on the Roman history,
which itis noc strange that he should understand, who
has mndeone of its grentes} heroes appear so 720be on
our ἕξ stage. ‘To my lecinned ancl ingenious friend [W.
Samuel Johnson I om very much obliged 3 not only for
his elegant effay on Pastorol Poetry‚ but for several
most judicious 'remarks and obser-votions fiattered thro'
the whole. Ἀ It was thought proper not to omit in this
edition, Bzfhop Atterhnry‘s celebrated ‘conjeffi‘ure‚ con-
cerning Iapis, in the twelftffhook of the AEneid. It
may be neceffory like-wife to take notice here that Μ.
Pitt has horrowed ahozztſsxty lines from Mn. Dryden,
and I myself about cc dozen, and ci remark or two in
ι the ,life of Virgz'l. Ι ane indebted also to Mu Benson
for some observations, ond forstx lines of his transsa-
tion of the two first Georgics. For the rest Ι cznz
answeroble 3 and Ι hope those readers that are able to
J'udge, who are likewzse ever most inclined to parabit,
will excuse the smaller faults and iiiadvertencies that
will neceffariiy hoppen in the course of so long a work.
