ECLOGUE THE SECOND.

ARGUMENT.

Afhepherd despairing to gain the affections of a youth, named —
Alexis, is here introduced, uttering those natural and
bitter complaints, that disappointed affection is sb apt to
suggaess. Dr. Trapp observes, ‘⁶ That there is no loose
idea, nor one immodest exprcffion in the whole picce3 which
means no more, than either the platonic love of the beauties,
both of body and mind, or excess offriendship, or rather
both. Experience gives us many instances of perfhns of the
samcfi'x, one of whom is beloved by the other, to an ex-
tremity of fondness, and almost dotage. I dare stry no
person, unlcfi monstrously debauched beforehfflvd, and st)
being α temptor to himself (which he may be in reading
not only innocent but sacred things) had ever an ill thought
suggested to him, by the reading eff this Eclogue.''
