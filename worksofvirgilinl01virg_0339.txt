Book 3. V Tm: GE0R01cs OF VIRGIL· 303

Our best of days advance with double speed,

a ’ Diseases, palus, a ghastly troop l succeed3
> With care, and labour, and complaining age,

Ἴ And ruthless death’s inexorable tage.
¹} For fresh supplies thy weary’d race remove 3 100
Nor place on one alone the weight of love.
Stin propagate thy breed with annual care, ”
And with new births the fleeting race repair.
Nor less with equal care sele& the steed 3

” Thou who resolv’st to rear a generous breed, 105
, Nurse from his earliest youth the chosen fire,
And feed with careful hand his native fire.
Ev’n now the-colt treads high with stately pace,
⁸ And moves his pliant limbs with ea-sy grace3
ἶ Outstrips the rest3 the first that dares to brave 1 10

' The unknown bridge, or tempt the threat’ning wave ;

No sudden sounds alarm his soul with dread3

Sublime his arched neck, and small his head :

Short paunch, and breadth of back his might estest,
And promInent with brawn his fearless breast. , 115
Of colom-s choose the dapple or the grey,

For white and dun a dastard race betray.

- Lo l when the battle’s distant din he hears,

Restless he paws 3 ereffoe his eager ears 3

With generous fury glows his quivering frame, 120
And from his nostril bursts the fierce, colle8oed flame-
O'er his right ssmulder his redundant mane

Δ Waves to the zephyr as he skims the plain.

Thro' his broad back shoots a divided spine,

Α And arms with double force his mighty chine. 125
While o’er the green as his fleet hoof is borne,

Echoes the trembling ground beneath the solid horn.
Such Cyllarus, by Spartan Pollux tam'd,

And such the steeds, in Grecian story fam'd,
, with fierceness and rage, neither believeth he (for joy !) that

it is the found rof the trumpet‚” is more spirited and strong than
any circumstance in Virgil’s pisture.
