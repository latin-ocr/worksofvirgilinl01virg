Book 4( Tm: Gsoamcs or Vmon.. 391

As in the rapid waves it roll’d along,

Ev'n then with faultering voice and feeble tongue‚

To name his poor Eurydice he try’d‚ 630
Eurydice, ⁴ with parting breath he cry'd,

Eurydice! the rocks and echoing {hores reply'd.

He spoke 3 and 'mid the waves his body hurl'd‚

About his head the foaming waters curl'd.

Not' so Cyrene; to asswage hisfears, 635
My son, {he eries, allay thy restless cares ς

Behold the cause of all this dire disease 3

The nymphs have sent destrue'tion on thy bees,

With whom Eurydice wasmont t' advance,

And lead in lofty groves the sacred dance. 640
Thou suppliant offer gists, and sue for peace,

The mild Napaeans will their anger cease3

But hear me first in order due declare,

The means to sooth their rage, and frame thy pray'r :
Sele& four large and beauteous bulls that crop 645
Thy verdant pastures on Lycaeus' top, ¹
Four heifers too, that ne’er have plough'd the field,

F'our altars in the Dryads' temples build3

From the ssain viEtims pour the sacred blood,

And leave their bodies in the shady wood : 650
*vVhen the ninth mom o’er dewy hills shall spring,

To Orpheus’ ghost Lethean poppies bring;

With a black ewe Eurydice adore,

And sned for her a vi‘Stim-heifer's gote :

Revifit then the grove. without delay 655
He speeds his mother’s precepts to obey 3 '
Hastes to the temple, there his altars builds, [ficlds ε
Four bulls, four heifers stads, that ne’er had plough'd the

point than is commonly imagined. These consequences greatly
aggravate the guilt of Aristaeus 3 and so it was proper enough,
if not absolutely necessary, to reeite them. W‘hether this
answer be sufficient, or not, I neither know, nor much carc,
Be it as it will, I would not lose this episode, to be the author
of all the best criticisms that ever were, or {hall be, written
upon the claffics, Ture.
