423· Βίτωνι] The descent of Aristaeus' into the earth, is
founded on an ancient superstition of the Egyptians. Servius
tells us, that on certain days sacred to :she Nile, boys born of
holy parents, were delivered to the nymphs by the priests;
who, when they were grown up, and returned back, reported,
that there were groves under the earth, and an immense water
containing all things, and from whence every thing is pro-
created. ,

432. Decp.] Thisis one of the most sublime paffages in Vir-
gil. Nothing can strike the imagination more strongly, than
to conceive a person entering the bowels of the earth, and at
once hearing and seeing the most celebrated rivers in the world
bursting forth from their several sources. The rough and hor-
rible scenes of rocks, caves, andwaters which Aristaeus pass'es
through, are at last finely softened by the kind reception he
meets with from his mother, and the graceful appearance of
the nymplis spinning and finging the loves of the Getis, Fra-
castorius has a descentinto the earth in search of metals, where,
no doubt, he had virgil in his eyo3 and in which he has' been
followed by Dr. Garth, in the Dispensary. '

438. Eridanus-the Pa] This passage cannot be better ex-
plained than by quoting the following words from Mr. Spence,
in his Polymetis:

“ But there is another thing in it, with which Ι am not yet
satitfiedz and that is, Virgil's calling the Po here, the most
viole„ ef all rivers. Ι know one of the most celebrated and
most ingenious writers of our age has endeavoured to soften
this, by understanding¹ it only of the rivers in Italy. But (not
to enquire at all whether the Po be really the most xiolent of
all the rivers in Italy) how can Virgil be understood οξ the

rivers
