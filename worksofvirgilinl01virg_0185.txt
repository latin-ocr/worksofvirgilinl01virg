‚ECLOGUE THE EIGHTH.

ARGUMENT.

ffhis is evidently an' imitation of the Φαρμακευτρια of Theo..

· critus, and is very valuable not only for its poetical beau-
ties, but likewise for the account it preserves to us of
several supeistitious rites and heathen notions of inchant-
nient. The poet seems to have had an high idea of his com—
position by his introducing it in so lofty a strain, quorum
*stupefazf‘tae carmine lynces. Yhe critics have been very
much divided whether it is inscribed to Pollio or Augustus.
Catrou pleads very strongly for Augustu53 but Dr. Martyn
largely examines this plea‚ and confutes it solidly. There
is doubtleſs a great stress to be laid on .

Sola Sophocleo tua carmina digna cothurno.

For though Augustus began a tragedy on the death of Aiax,
(after Sophocles) yet this piece was ‘never publzss'ed, as
many fine ones of Pollio were, who is highly celebrated by

³ Horace for his dranzatic excellence. Lib. II. Od. 1.
Motum ex Pv1etello‚ ἃς. The enchantments described ,1
in this Eclogue, are fincly imitated in the ARCADIA del
SANNAZORO ; a book to which our Sir Philip Sidney in
bis Arcadia is much indebtecl. Sannazaro has there given

a laese to his fancy, and has fhcwn that he had a very
exuberant one.—Prcsa. 10.
