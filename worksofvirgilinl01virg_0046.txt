Even the admired Augustus was deeply indebted to this
favourite, for guiding his taste and forming his man-⁴ ι
ners. 'Twas he who introduced the poets to his court3'
inspired him with a relish for polite learning3 convinced
him of the importance of having his character handed
down to posterity in an amiable light by the best writers
of his age, and of having his statue made by none but
a Lysippus, That the emperor wanted such a master
to sosten and polish his temper and behaviour, is suffia
ciently testified by Suetonius and other authors, who
tell us of his natural love of amphitheatrical spectacles,
and other barbarous entertainments, little accommodated
to the interestm* the Rsluses. Horace, in his artful and
concealed manner, frequently glances at this, in many
passages of the celebrated epistle in his second booka
And Dion Caffius in particular relates the frank treat—

I cannot forbear adding a little reflection, which may·

serve, among others, to convince us of the great power:- ι

fulness of poetry3 which is, that we should have enter-

reality a cool, a cruel and subtle tyram, and the person ·
who gave the last wound to expiring liberty, if Virgil and
Horace had not so highly celebrated·him‚ and gained us

as it were over to his party. But perhaps the reflets'cion '

does not much honour to these two poets.

We are at last arrived to the period of time when
virgil began writing his AEneid, in the year of Rome
714, when he himself was forty-five years old. His de- ,
fign in writing it has been very lately so excellently cx-
