‚ECLOGUE THE, FIFTH,

ARGUMENT.

,Ἴ Thesuhjeb? of the following Eclogue is great, and the poet la-
. boured his composition accordingly3 it is no les than the
death of Julius (ludar, and hig· dgzfication. Many rea-
sons may‘h‘sgi-ven, why hy Daphnis is not meant Saloni-
nus, the pretended son of Pollio, nor Flaccus, Virgil’s
[brother. This Eclogue must have greatly recommended our
author to the favour of Augustus. Ruaeus thinks it was
written when some plays or sacrifices were celebrated in
honour cffJulius Caesar. The scene ofit is not only
beautiful in izss’lf, but adapted to the' fhlemnity of the
subjebt 3 the fhephcrdsstt andstng in the awqful gloom of ιζ
grette, which is overhung by wild vines.
