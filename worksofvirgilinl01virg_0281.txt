J0ve’s oak, or palm high-waving o’er the steep‚
And fir now fit to tempt the dang’rous deep.

, On th' horrid arbute graft the walnut's spray, 85
Or bid with apples barren planes look gay :
Oft has the beech improv'd, the chesnut bore,
The wild ash stood with pear-tree bloss'oms hoar, }
And swine beneath the elm have crack'd the masty store.

The swains who graft‚ employ a different art 90
From those, who to the bark a bud impart :

For ‘thro' the rind where bursts the tender gem,

Fast by the knot they wound the taper stem,

Then in the ssit an alien bud confin’d,

They teach to knit congenial with the rind ; 95
Or thro' the poliss1’d trunk they wedge their way,

And in the chasm insert a lusty spray;

Ere long to heaven the soaring branches shoot,

And wonder at their height, and more than native fruit.
Befides‚ of sturdy elms a different kind, 100
Of willows‚ and the watery lote, we find.

Th' Idean cypress various looks assumes,

In numerous forms the luscious olive blooms :

Nor Orchite's nor the Radius' kind is one,

Nor Paufia’s by their bitter berries known 3 105

under the articles of improvementsoe, he observes, that chance-

plants, which are naturally wilci, may be civilized by grafting,
as crabs, ssoes, or wild plums, διε.

 

 

Tamen haec quoquest quis
Instrat, aut scrobibus mandet mutata subaffis,
Exuerint levestrem animum.

Having thus sufficiently mentioned this practice, and there be-
ing no neceffity to repeat it as he endeavours to be as concise
as poffible3 he proceeds in the next place to tell us, that trees
of different kinds may likewise be grafted on each other. And
as he had before shewed, in the four preceding verses', what art
could do in transplanting tall trees; he advances here to Ihew
what may lilzewise be done by the help of art in grafting, viz.
that any scion may be ingrafted on any stock. All the trans-

lators have mistaken this passage: and Ι am indebted to Mt.
Holdsworth for his clearing it up.
