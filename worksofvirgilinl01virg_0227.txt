Book¹ 1. THE Gssonmcs 01·- VIRGIL. 195

Scorpius e’en now his burning claws confines,

And more than a just share of heav’n resigns?

VVhate’er thou choose3 (for sure thou wilt not deigm.

With dire ambition fir'd, in hell to reign, 50

Tho' Greece her fair Elyfian fields admire,

Whence Proserpine refuses to ferire)—

Look kindly down, my invocations hear !

Affist my course, and urge my bold career3

Pity with me, the simple ploughman's cares, 55

Now, now assume the god, and learn to hear our pray’rs.
In earliest spring, when melting snow distils

Adown the mountains’ fides, in trickling risss,

WVhen Zephyr’s breeze unbinds the crumbling soil,

Then let my· groaning steers begin the toil 3 φ

Deep in the furrows press the [hining share3

Those lands at last repay the peasants' care,

Which twice the sun, and twice the frosts sustain,

And burst his barns surcharg’d with pond'rous grain.

But ere we launch the plough in plains unknown, 65

Be first the clime, the winde and weather shewn 3

The temper and the genius of the fields,

, What each refuses, what in plenty yields5

tus in holding that, would be supposed to be the guardian
angel of his country aster his decemb, as he had been so for-
maily declared to be the father and protec'tor of it in his life-
time. Upon the whole, Ι do not see how any thought of this
kind could have been carried on with more propriety, than this
seems to have been, by the admirers or flatterers of that emperor.

¹. Martyn‚ did not confine themselves to the computation of
¹ astrologers3 but dated their spring from the end of the frosty
weather. Pqfficnt igilur ιιι· idibus Jamcariis, ut principt‘m mensem
