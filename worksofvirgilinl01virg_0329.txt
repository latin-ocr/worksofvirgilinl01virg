For him, myself to grace the solemn feast,
Chief of the spons, in Tyrian purple drest,

scendent perfefflom and tasting, beforehand, the pains of a
remediless vexation‚ strongly pietured in the image of the worst,
infernal tortures.

INVI ΝΑ ifffelix furias amnemque severum
Cocyti metim, tortosque Ixionis orbes,
Immanemque rotam, et non exsuperabile saxum.

Thus have Ipresumed, but with a religious awe, to inspe&
and declare the mysteries of this ideal temple. The attempt
after all might have been censured‚ as profane, if the great
Ilu'ystagogue himself, or somebody for him*, had not given us

‘· the undoubted key to it. Under this encouragement I could

not withstand the temptation of disclosing thus much of one of
the noblest fiffions of antiquity3 and the rather, as the propri·
eety of allegoric composition, which made the distinguished pride
of ancient poetry, seems but little known or attended to by
modern profeffors of this fine art‘.

 

¹ In these lines,

Mox tamen ardentis accingar dicere pugnas
Caesaris, ὅ nomen fama tot ferre per annos,
Tithoni prima quot abest ab origine Caesar.

WhichI suspest not to have been from the hand of Virgil,
And,

1. ‚On account of some peculiarities in the exprffon.

Accingar is of frequent use in the best authors, to denote a
readiness and resolution to do any thing; but as joined with an
infinitive moad, accingar dicere, I do not remember to have ever
seen it. ’Tis often used by virgin but, if the several places
be consulted, it will always be found with an accusati-ve and
prepcfition, expreffed or understood, as magicas accingier artes,
or with an accusative and dative, as accingere fi> praedae, or
lastly with an ablati-ve, expreffing the instrument, as accingor
ferro. La cerda, in his notes upon the place, seemed sensible
. of the obje&ion‚ and therefore wrote, Graeca lot-urio .· the com-
mon, but pahry, shift of learned critics‚ when they determine,
at any rate, to support an ancient reading.

2. Ardentes pugnas, burning bailles, sounds well enough to a
modern ear3 but I much doubt if it would have pafi'ed in the
times of Virgil. At least, I recolleft no such expreffion in all
his works; ardens* being constantly joinedto τι word, denoting
a substance of apparent light, hear, or flame‚ to which the allu-
fion is easy, as ardentes gladios, ardentes oculos, campos armis
sublimibus ardentes, and by an easy trumphos, ardentes hostes,
