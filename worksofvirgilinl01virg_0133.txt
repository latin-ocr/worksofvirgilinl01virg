Ecl. 3. THE EcLoGUEs OF V1RG1L. 103

Whose easy chiffel o’er the work has twin'd‚
A vine with berries of pale ivyjoin’d. 50
Full in the midst two cornely forms appear,
Conon, with him who fram’d that wond'rous sphere,
Which points the change of seasons> to the swain,
And when to plough the soil, or reap the grain.
These are rny pledge3 which yet with care I keep 55
Untouch'd‚ and unpolluted by the lip.

DAMOETAS.
I have a pair by the same artist made,
Their handles with acanthus' leaves 0'erlaid‚
Where Orpheus in the midst attrae'ts the grove—
But my first-proffer'd prize is still above 60
All we can stake3 tho' yet my cups I keep

. Untouch'd, and unpolluted by the lip.

MENALCAS.
Name your own terms‚ nor think the field to fly,
We’ll choose‚ for judge, the first who paffes by--·
let him the cause decide3 65
For once I’ll tame an empty boaster's pride.
DAMoETAs.
I fear the threats of no vain-glorious swain,
No proud Menalcas, nor his vaunted strain.
The song, Palaemon, with attention hear,
No mean debate demands thy listening earu 70
PALAEMON.

Palaemon comes

 

Regin, smce on the tender turf we rest,

And fields and trees in fruitful stores are drest.
The lofty groves their verdant livery wear,
And in full beauty blooms the laughing year.
