the sentiments. .

In consequence of these original errors, a thousand
precepts have been given, which have only contributed
to perplex and to confound. Some have thought it ne-
cessary that the imaginary manners of the Golden Age
should be universally preserved, and have therefore be-
lieved, that nothing more could be admitted in Pastoral‚
'than lilies and r'ose's, and rocks and streams, among
which are heard the gentle whispers of chaste fondness,
or the soft complaints of amorous impatienhce. In Pas-

virtue.

Yet these advocates for the Golden Age lay down othei·
principles, not very consistent with their general plan,
for they 'tell us, that, to support the charadier of the

supposed to have forgo't the name of Anaximander, and
in Pope the term Zodiac is too hard for a rustic appre-

primitive condition, we may give them learning among
their other qualifications, and if we suffer them to al-

cannot with any great propriety be allowed, there can
be no danger of making them speak with too much ac-
curacy, since they conversed with divinities‚ and trans-
mitted to succeeding ages the arts of life.

Other writers, having the mean and despicable con-
dition of a shepherd always before them, conceive it
necessary to degrade the language of Pastoral, by obso-
