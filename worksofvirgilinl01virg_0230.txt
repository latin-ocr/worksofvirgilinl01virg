Sed tamen alternis facilis labor: arida tantum

Ne saturare fimo pingui pudeat sola3 neve 80
Effoetos cinerem inmundum jai-{lare per agros.

Sic quoque mutatis requiescunt foetibus arva.

Nec nulla interea est inaratae gratia terrae.

Saepe etiam sterilis incendere profuit agros,

Atque levem stipulam crepitantibus urere flammis : 85
Sive inde occultas vires, et pabula terrae

Pinguia concipiunt : five illis omne per ignem
’Excoquitur vitium, atque exsudat inutilis humor t

Seu pluris calor ille vias et caeca relaxat

Spitamenta‚ novas veniat qua succus in herbas ε 90
Seu durat magis, et venas adstringit hiantis:

Ne tenues pluviae, rapidive potentia solis

Acrior, aut Boreae penetrabile frigus adurat.

Multum adeo, rastris glebas qui frangit inertis,
Vimineasque trahit crates, juvat arva z neque illum 95
Flava Ceres alto nequicquam spe&at Olympo ε

Et qui, proscisso quae suscitat aequore terga,

Rursus in obliquom verso perrumpit aratro,

Exercetque frequens tellurem, atque imperat arvis.

102. To burn tlte barren gleba] Virgil, says Mr. Benson (but
he seems to be milhma) speaks of two different thingS, of
burning the soil itseif before the ground is ploughed, and of
burning the stubble after the corn is taken off from arable land.
T he rapidity of saepe levem stipulam crepitantibus urere flammis,
expresses the craekling aud swiftness of the fiame.

¹03· While the [⁷an stabbla] They still use the method* so
much recommendat by virgil (Geo. I. 84 to 93) of burning
the slawic, especially in the more barren fields, in most parts
of lmiy; and about Rome in particular, where there is so
much bad ground. The {niolze is very troublesome when they
do it; and there had been so many complaints made of it to Cle-

ment Xi. that he had resolved to forbid that praclice. When ’ᾗ

the order was laid before that pope, to bc figned by him3 a
cardinal (who happened to be with his holiness) spoke much

of thr.- use of it; shewed him this pass'age in Vir-giu and the

pope on reading it, changed his mind, and rejeaed the order.
