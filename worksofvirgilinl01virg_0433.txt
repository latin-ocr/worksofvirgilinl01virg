DIDACTIC POETRY. 397

As material objee'ts are most susceptible of poetica] or-
naments, so perhaps, the various employments‚ bufinesses,
and amusements of life, together with the elegant arts
and sciences, are more proper subjeE'ts for didaffic poe-
try, than such as are purely speculative and metaphyfical.
Abstra& ideas admit but of few embelliihments. All
parts of natural philosophy in particular, as being con-
versant about senfible images, seem the best calculated to
{hine in this way of writing;

—-- coelique vias et sidera monstrent,

objicibus ruptis, rursusque in seipsa resident 3
‚Quid tantum oceano properent se tingere soles
Hjaeberni, vel quae tardis mora* nofflibus obstet.

We have some elegant but short specimens of this sort in

, the Mufhe Anglicanae .· such are the poems on a barome-

and on Dr. Hales’s vegetable statics.

In making choice of a proper subject, regard should be
had, to fix, if poffible, upon one of an important and

mankind. Such is Dr. Armstrong’s poem on the art of
preserving health. And after this interesting subject is
chosen, only such rules relating to it should be selected,
as will bear to be delivered gracefully3 and to be en-
livened with poetical imagery. It is not required or ex·-
peE’oed of a poet, to enter into a minute detail of dry
precepts, but to single out those precepts, that will en·-
tertain as well as instruct his reader.

·-—- et quae
Desperat ΐναέῗατα nitescere pff, relinquit. HOR.

Mr. Addison observes, that there are several ways of con·
veying the same truth to the mind of man; and to choose

the pleasantest of these ways, is that which chiefly dis-
