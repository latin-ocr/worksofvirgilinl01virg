Book 1. Tm: GnoRmcs oF Vmcxr.. 235 Ἰ

Where sacred order, fraud and force confound,
Where impious wass and tumults rage around, 590}
And every various vice and crime is crown’d :
Difflonour’d lies the plough3 the banish’d swains

Are hurried from th’ uncultivated plain53

The fickles into barbarous swords are beat,

Euphrates here, there war the Germans threat. 595
The neighbouring cities break faith’s mutual hands,

And ruthless Mars raves wild o’er all the lands.

As. when four furious coursers whirl away

The trembling driver‚ nor his eries obey,

With headlong haste swift-pouring o’er the plainS, 600

The chariot bounds along, nor hears the teins.

END OF THE FIRST GEoRGIC.
