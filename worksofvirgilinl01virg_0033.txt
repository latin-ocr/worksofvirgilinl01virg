Ad 'Villam Scironis. -

V Mula, 'quae Scironis eras, ξδ’ pauper agelle,
Verum illi domino tu quoque diviti-'m

After Virgilhad compleated his studiee at Naples‚ Dona-2
tus affirms, that he made a ‚journey to Rome3 that by
his extraordinary skill in the diseases incident to cattle
of all kinds, he recommended himself to Augustus's master
of the horse, who procured appointments for him in
the royal stables; that Augustus having a colt presented to
him by the Crotoniates which promised uncommon swift-
ness and' spirit, virgil immediately pronounced that he
came from a fickly mare, and would be good for nothing,
which proved the case; and lastly, that the emperor hear-
ing of his extraordinary penetration and discernment,
sent for him privately to enquire concerning his own
parentage, whether he was really the son of Octavius or
not. But Ruaeus and the most judicious critics have re·-
je&ed and refuted these stories as highly fabulous, imz-
probable, and impertinent3 and are of opinion that he did
not appear at Rome, and was not known to Augustus till
long afterwards. Perhaps 'tis safest to steer betwi:‹;t these
two opposite opinions, and to say, that our Poet might:
probably pay a visit to Rome, and be introduced to Au⁴
gustus, though not by the methods Donatus has afligned.

passage in the first Eclogue,

Stultus ego huic ncgstrae similem
