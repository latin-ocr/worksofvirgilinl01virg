je& of these verses by Mr. Holdsworth was publilhed not long
ag‘is (ἔῖοῶὴῖἷῖ, 1333.ffssinffinyggsseffiges ἀῗῗῗῗίἱῗῗὲιῧὲ

and the short remark added, that some trees thrive best, not by
the ordinary way of planting, but by layers and truncheons,

Sed truncis oleae melius, δ’ c.

virgil proceeds next to another sort of planting, still more dif-
ficult3 and tells us, that not only young plants and trunche- ς’
ons may be removed, but even grown trees. This is methodi- -
eal, and consistent with what preceded, the tranfition easy, and
the climax just. We continue still in the plantation, but we
are led into a part we had seen nothing of before, a grove of
some confiderable growth‚ newly planted. And therefore we Δ
may observe, all the epithets and decorations, used here to en-
liven the subjeet, are suited to trees of an advanced age,

By this interpretation it must appear already, that the epithet-
ανιίιιιι, which is a difficulty with Dr. Mar-tyn, becomes plain
and easy : and indeed it was so far from embarrassing me, that ’
it helped to explain what went before. We advance farther
in the plantation, and are fhexvn, that even the palm too (an
exotio) may be transplanted when tall, or, in poetic language,
bc lssorn ιι tree3 and so likewise the fir, when grown fit for a
mal .

Vl'e may very reasonably imagine, that in Virgil's time, that
nge of luxury, the great men of Rome transplanted tall trees
from woods and nurserics, as is frequently done with us, into
their walks and gardens. Maecena-02, to whom this book is de-
