Tuque ades, inceptumque una decurre laborem, ’

O decus, ὃ famae merito pars maxima nostrae, 40
Maecenas3 pelagoque volans da vela patenti.

Non ego cunita meis ampleEti versibus opto:

Non, mihi si linguae centurn sint, oraque centum,

Ferrea vox. ades, ct primi lege litorisv oram.

In manibus terrae. non hic te carmine flesto, 45
Atque per ambages et longa exorsa tenebo.

Sponte sua quae se tollunt in luminis oras,

Infecunda quidem, sed laeta et fortia surgunt:

Qippe solo Natura subest. tamen haec quoque fi quis

had put him upon, and again begs his assistance. In the
fourth book, he defires him to look favourably upon that piece,
and addrefl‘es it more particularly to him, than he had done
any of the former. 'Tis true there is no great eclat in all
this, but the compliment to Maecenas lies here. Virgil under-
took a very necessary work for the service of his prince, and
his country. He declares it was Maecenas put him upon
it. He found the work very difficult, but still Maecenas ,,
persuades him to perfist in it; and by his patronage, and his‘
