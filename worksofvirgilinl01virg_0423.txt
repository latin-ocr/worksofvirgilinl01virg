Book 4. ’ THE Groncncs or Vmony 387

Thick as the birds to leafy groves descend,

When evening clouds, or wintry storms impend3 565
Mothers and husbands‚ heroes' aweful {hade-s,

‘Sweet infant boys, and pure unmarried maids,

Youths whose fond parents saw their bloom expire,

And sorrowing plac'd them on the funeral pyrej,

Whom black Cocytus' sullen waters bound, 570
Foul shores of mud with reeds unfightly crown’d,

‘And the nine streams of winding Styx surround 3 ’ }
Ev'n these dread mansions listen’d with amaze3

With awe, death’s deepest dungeons heard his lays;
Struck were the snake-crown’d Furies ; Cerberus shews
His jaws wide-gaping, yet in a& to close3 ⁴ 576
'A-pause of rest the sad Ixion found,

His wheel stopt sudden at the powerful found.

And now at length no farther toil remain’d‚

The upper air Eurydice regain'd, 580
Behind sne came, so Proserpine ordain’d ε

¹‘When strait a frenzy the fond lover caught,

(Could' Hell forgive, ’twas sure a venial fault)

Ev'n on life’s confines, impotent of mind,

He stopt, alas ! and cast one look behind. 585
Fell Pluto's terms he broke ! his hopes were lost!

Α groan thrice echoed o'er Avernus’ coast.

Ah ! who destroys us both, she sadly cry'd,

What madnesS, Orpheus, tears thee from thy bride ?
The cru'el fates force me again away ἔ 590
My swimming eyes no more discern the day3

arvernis, says the original very finely. A‘certain dismal and
hollow sou'nd was heard through the vaults of hell. Some
imagine, bu‘t Ι think groundlessly,›th'at it was the shout of
ghosts rejoicing for Eurydice's return. Surely the other sense
ιε far the more poetical and more forcibly imagined.
