Book 2. ‘THE GEoRorcs oF V1RG11.. 257

Here the wild olive woods luxuriant {hoot‚ 230
And all the plains are strewn with sylvan fruit.
But the rich soil with genial force endu’d,
All green with grass, with moisture sweet bedew'd,
Such as we oft survey from cavern’d hius,
Whence many a stream descends in dripping rills, 235}
And with rich ooze the fatt'ning valley fills;
Or that which feels the balmy southern air,
And feeds the fern unfriendly to the fhare;
Ere long will vines of lustiest growth produce,
And big with bounteous Bacchus' choicest juice, 240
Will give the grape, in solemn sacrifice,
Whose purple stream the golden goblet dies ;
When the fat Tuscan’s horn has call’d the god,
And the full chargers bend beneath the smol<ing load.
But bullocks would you rear, and herds of cow8‚ 245
Or sheep, or goats that crop the budding boughs 3
Seek rich Tarentum’s planis, a distant coast,
And fields like those my luckless Nlantua lost ;
His filver-pinion'd swans where Mincio feeds,
As ssow they sail among the wat'ry weedS. 250
There for thy flocks fresh fountains never fail,
Undying verdure cloaths the graffy vale3
And what is crop'd by day, the night renews,
Shedding refreshful stores of cooling dews.
A sable mold and fat beneath the share, 255
That crumbles to the touch, of texture rare,
And (what our art effefts) by nature loose,
Will the best growth of foodful gain produce:
And from no field, beneath pale evening’s star 259
With heavier harvests fraught, returns the nodding car.
Or else the plain, from wh1ch the ploughman's rage
Has fell'd the forest, hoar through many an age,
And tore the tall trees from their ancient base,
Long the dark covert of the feathery race 3
