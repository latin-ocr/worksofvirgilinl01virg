but no where, that Ι can find, to so abstra& a notion‚ as that
of fight. It seems to be to avoid this difficulty, that some
have chosen to read ardentis, in the geniti-ve, which yet Servius
rejefts 35 of ro authori( cv.

3. But the mon glaring note of illegitimacy' 15 in the line,

Tithon t prima quot abest ab origzne C aasar

It has puzzled all the commentators from old Servius down to
ΜΓ. Martyn, to give any tolerable account of the poet's choice
of cFithmzus, from whom to derive the ancestry of Augustus,
rather than Anchfis‚ 01· Affizracus, who were not only more
famous, but 111 the direL‘Z line. The pretences of any or 311Ι of ‚
them are too frivolous to make it neccfl'ary to spend a thought
about thern. The instance stands fingle in antiquity3 much less
is there any tbi ,ng like it to be found m the Augustan poets.

meaning? Nothing can be more abhorrent from the usual ad-
dress and artifice ot* Virgil’s manner. Or,

defi„1nce of 311 the Jaws of dtjspqſstion, came it to be forced in

perceive that this could never be the place for it. The allego-
ry being conduded, the poet returns to his subje&, which is
proposed. in the fix following lines:
