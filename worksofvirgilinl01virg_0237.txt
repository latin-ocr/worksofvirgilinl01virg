The beauteous tilth‚ and blights o’er' the rich crops pre-

Unless with‘harrows’ unremitted ton,

Thou break, subdue, and pulverize the soil, 185

Fright pecking birds, lop overffiadowing bowers,

And beg of smiling Heav'n refreshful mowers,

[Alas ἔ thy neighbour’s stores with envy view’d5
Thou'lt shake from forest—oaks thy tasteless food.

Next must we tell, what arms stout peasants wield, 190
Without whose aid, no crops could crown the field :
The {harpen'd share, and heavy-timber’d plough,

And Ceres’ pond’rous waggon, rolling ssow3

And Celeus' harrows, hmdles, sseds to trail

O’er the press'd grain, and Bacchus’ flying sail. 195
These long before provide, you, who incline

To merit praise by hulbandry divine l

I have borrow'd a few lines from Mr. Benson’s transsation of
this passage.

195· Bacchus’ftying sad] The persons who were initiated
into any ofthe ancient mysteries, were to be particularly good ;
they looked upon themselves as separated from the vulgar of
mankind, and dedicated to a life of singular virtue and piety.

This may be the reason that the fan or van, the ngystz'ca van·
’ nus Iacchi, was used in initiations: The instrument that se-

parates the wheat from the chaff being as proper an emblem
’ as can well be, of setting apart the geod and virtuous from the
wicked or useless part of mankind.

ln the drawings of the ancient paintings by Bellori, there are
two that seem to relate to initiations 3 and each of them has the
vannus in it. In one of thern, the person that is initiating‚
stands in a devout posture, and with a veil on, the old mark of
devotion3 while two that were formerly initiated hold the van
over his head. In the other there is a person holding a van,
with a young infant init. The latter may fignisy much the
same with the scripture expreffion, entering into a state of vir-
tue “ as a little child.” Mark x. ις. The van itselfputs one
in mind of another text relating to a particular purity of lise,
and the separation of the good from the bad, “ whose fan is in
“ his hand, and he shall thoroughlypurge his floor, and will
“ gather the wheat into his gamem but the chaff he will
“ burn with unquenchable fise-'⁷ Luke iii. 17.
