Stil] day by day more huge the flend appears, 670
Till high to heav'n her horrid head {he rears:

While lowings loud‚ ancl many a mournful bleat‚

The withering banks and hanging hills repeat:

At length whole herds to death at once She sweeps‚
High in the stalls she pilcs the loathsome heaps3 675
Dire spe&acle ! till fage experience found

To bury deep the carrion in the ground.

Useless their hides ; nor from the flesh the flame

Could purge the fisth, nor streams the favour tame.

Nor could their skins supply the woolly store, 680
O’ergrown with scabs, and stiff with many a sore:
Wove from such fleeces those who wore a vest,

Were with foul sweats, and burning spots oppress'd3

With dire contagious touch consum’d the putrid frame.

an erysipelas or St. Anthony' s fire may be meant. But per-
haps sacer may mean accur sed, or dire-*fu l-—auri sacra fames—-
fizcer esto. I cannot agree with many critics, that Virgil hath
on the whole excelled his master Lucretius in his descrip-
tion of the plague. There are several strokes of the strongest
paindng, and the deepest pathetic in Lucretius' s fixth book;
which fixth book, by the way, seems but an odd and imperfest '
conclufion of his work.
