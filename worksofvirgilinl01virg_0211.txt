Ecl- 10. THE Eezocuns or·- Vmon„ 181

“ To seek another youth thy false one flies,

“ Thro' martial terrors and inclement ss<ies.'’

Shaking the suffic honours of his brow,

The lilly tall, and fennel’s branching bough,

Sylvanus came3 and Pan, Arcadia’s pride, 35
With vermil-hues, and blushing elder dy'd ε

“ Ah l why indulge, he eries, thy boundless grief,

‘⁶ Think’st thou that love will heed, or bring relief?

“ Nor tears can love suffice, nor showers the grass,

“ Nor leaves the goat, nor flowers the honied race.'' 40
Sad Gallus them—Yet O Arcadian swains,

Ye best artificers of soothing strains l

Tune your soft reeds, and teach your rocks my woes,

So shall my {hade in sweeter rest repose 3

Ο that your birth and bus’ness had been mine, 45
To feed the flock, and prune the spreading vine !

There some soft solace to my amorous mind,

Some Phillis or Amyntas I should find:

(What if the boy’s smooth {kin be brown to view,
Dark is the hyacinth and violet’s hue) 50
There as we lay the vine's thick {hadas beneath,

The boy should sing, and Phillis twine the wreath.
Here cooling fountains roll thro’ flow'ry amada,

Here woods, Lycoris l lift their verdant heads,

Here could I wear my careless life away, 55
And in thy arms insenfibly decay.

Instead of that, me frantie love detains‚

''Mid foes, and deathful darts, and bloody plains ;

While you, and ean my soul the tale believe, ἲ
Far from your country, lonely wand'ring leave, 60
Me, me your lover, barbarous fugitive ! ς

Seek the rough Alps, where snows eternal shine,
And joyless borders of the frozen Rhine.

1 53. These four lines are taken from Sir Geor-ge Lyttelton’s
erogant Eclogues, entitled, The progrcjss qf love.
