Yet still must he subdue, still turn the m01d5
And his ripe grapes still sear J0ve's piercing cold⁶
But happier olives ask nor pains nor care, 505
When rooted once, they mount into the air, ’
Nor harrow’s teeth‚ nor arched knives demand,
But self·sustain’d‚'alone, and vig-Orous, stand.
If crooked teeth just make her surface loose,
The earth alone the plants supplies with juice ; 510
But if more deep thy ploughs unlock the soil,
From the large berries burst rich floods of oil ε
’ Then ne'er to raise the fruitful olive cease,
The plant of Pallas, and the pledge of peace.
And when th’ engrafted apples feel their strength, 515
Their trunks they stretch‚ and doubled is their length;
While swift they dart into the lofty skies,
sels-nouri1h'd stand, nor ass< from man supplies.
Nor less wild fruits in pathless forests grow;
And haunts of birds with blushing berries glow3 52&
The cytisus of foodful leaves is 1horn,
And prudence finds an use in ev'ry thorn.
The pitchy pines afford us heat and light,
’ To cheat the tedious gloom of wintry night. .
And can the swains still doubt, and still forbear, 525
VTo plant, to dig, and cultivate, with care ἶ
⁷ Why fing Ῑ trees alone, that loftier rise ?
The lowly broom to cattle, browze supplies 3
Willows to panting shepherds {hade dispense,
To bees their honey, and to corn defence. 5 30
What joy to see Cytorus vvave with box,

} And pines nod aweful on Narycium’s rocks ἓ

Ι Fields, that ne’er felt or rake or cleaving ffiare,
Wild above art, disdaining human care l

Thus he makes this work of universal concern. All lands
will not bear vines, or corn, oi· olive53 but every land will

ἵ bear something or other, and by pointing out the produce of
ζ the sevexal kinds of soil, he applies himself te all soi-ts of coun-
