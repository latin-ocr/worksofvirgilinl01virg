MENALCAS, DAMOETAS‚ PMAEMOffi,

MENALcAs.
ΑΗΕ these, Damoetas, Meliboeus' sheep?

DAMoETAs.
N0; these their master Aegon bade me keep.
MENALCAS.
Unhappy sheep! yet more unhappy swain!
Whilst he Neaera wooes, but wooes in vain;
And fears lest I by fairer fortune blest 5
should win precedence in the virgin's breast;
Lo! here an hireling wastes his master’s gains,
And twice an hour of milk the cattle drains.
How lean, too deeply drain’d‚ appear the dams ,ἵ
And cheated of their milk how pine the lambs! 10
DAMOETAS.
At least to men this scoffing language spare;
We know that you-with whom—and when—and where:
We know the cave—'tis well the nymphs were kind,
Nor to the deed the leering goats were blind.
MENALCAS.
Ay, the kind nymphs, forsooth, no notice took, 15
Ξ When Mycon's vine I tore with wicked hook.
' DAMOETAS.
Or rather when, yon ancient beech below,
In spite you broke young Daphnis' darts and bow.
i O swain perverse! nay, when the boy receiv’d
Ξ The gift, oh! how your jealous foul was griev'd! 20
Ἰ ’Twas well you found that way, or you, I ween,
Ξ Had died invery impotence of spleen.
