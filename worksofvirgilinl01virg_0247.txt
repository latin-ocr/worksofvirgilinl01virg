Betwixt the first and these, indulgent Heav'n

Two milder zones to feeble man harh giv'n 3

Across them both a path oblique inclines, Ἴ 280
Where in refulgent orde-r roll the figns.

Bleak Scythia's snows, Riphaea’s tow'ring clifts,

High as this elevated globe uplifts,

So low to southern Libya it descends‚

And with an equa] inclination bends. 285
One pole for ever o'er our heads is roll’d,

One, darksome Styx and hell’s pale ghosts behold
Beneath their feet: here, the vast Dragon twines
Between the Bears, and like a river winds5

The Bears that still with fearful caution keep 290
Unting’d beneath the sur-face of the deep.

There, in dead silence, still night loves to rest,

Night without end, with thickest gloom opprest;

Or from our hemisphere, the morning ray

Returns alternate, and restores the day3 295
And when to us the orient car succeeds,

And o’er our elimes have breath’d its panting steeds,
There ruddy Vesper, kindling up the sky,

Casts o'er the glo-wing realms his evening eye.

Hence, changeful Heav’n's rough storms we may forekn0w‚

The days to resp, the happiest times to sow; 301

When with safe oars it may be fit to sweep

The glassy surface of the faithless deep3 γ

Ὦνὶιεὴ tothe waves the well-arm'd fleet refign,

And when in forests fell the timely pine. 305
Nor vain to mark the varying figns our care,

Nor the four seasons of th’ adjusted year; Δ

ἶ Whene’er the hind a sseety show'r detains,

Full many a work that soon must cost him pains

’ spumeus, and omits it as such.
