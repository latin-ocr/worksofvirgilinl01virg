Booleh THECEoRmes oF Vmcssin. 225

Loudly the fains the boding rook demands, 460
And solitary stalks across the scorehing sands.
Nor less the ‘virgins nightly tasks that weave
With busy hands, approaching storms perceive,
While on the lamp they mark the sputtering oil,
And fungous clots the light, adhffive, soil. 465
Nor less by certain marks may'st thou descry
Fair seasons‚ in the calm, and stormless ss4y3
Then {hine the stars with keener lustre bright,
Nor Cynthia borrows from her brother’s light.
No fleecy clouds flit lightly through the air, 470
The mists descend5 and low o'n earth appear.
Nor Thetis’ halcyons basking on the strand,
Their plumage to the tepid sun expand :
Nor swine deep delving with the sordid snout, -
Delight to toss the bundled straw about'. 475
To watch the setting sun, the sullen owl
Sits penfive‚ and in vain repeats her baleful how'l ;
Nisus appears sublime in liquid air,
And Scylla rues th'e ravish'd purple hair 2

” Where with swift wings she cuts th’ etheria] way, 480
Fierce Nisus presses on his panting prey, }
Where Nisus wheels, she swiftly darts away.
With throats compress'd‚ with ihi-ill and clearer voice,
The tempest gone, the cawing rooks rejoice 3
Seek with unusual joys, on branches hung 485
Their much-lov'd nests, and seed their callow young.

477. In vain repeats.] Dr. Trapp interprets nequicquam, in
Λευεὶν), Dr. Martyn, not repeats.-1f we understand the poet to
be speaking of the continuance of fair weather, nequicquam must
fignify not3 because, according to Pliny, the hooting of the
owl· at such a time would be a fign of rain.

Mr. Dryden has strangely transsated this passage ι

And owls that marl< the setting sun declare,
A star-light evening and a morning fair.
