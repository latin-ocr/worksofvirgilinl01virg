Ecl. ς. THE Eciocuzs 01-· Vmcn„ ηε)

For violet soft, for purple dastbdiil, 45
Brambles and prickly burrs the meadows fill.

With boughs the brooks o’ershade5 ye rural tram, ἶ
With leaves and flowers bespread the verdant plain3
Daphnis these rites did for himself ordain. ς
With grateful hands his monument erodi, 50
And be the stone with this inscription deck’d 3
‘⁶ I DaphniS here repose3 fam’d to the sky,

‘⁶ Fair was my flock, but fairer far was I !’'
MENALCAS.

O bard divine i as sweet thy tuneful lay,

As ssumber to tir'd swains on new-mown hay, 55

Or as in summer's sultry drought to taste

Cool streams that bubbling o’er the meadows haste.

Thou ev’n with Pan deserv’st an equal meed,

For skill to tune the voice or touch the reed-

Blest youth ἔ who now ssialt share that master’s fame ; 642

Yet will I strive th’ alternate lays to frasne z

Bid Daphnis' praises to the stass ascend,

For Daphnis lov'd ev’n me, his humble friends

Mopsus.
How can'st thou please me more ?-The youth thy praise
Deserv’d, and Stimichon approves the lays. 65
MENALCAS.

DaphniS with wonder mounts to heav'ri on high,

Above the clouds, above the starry ss<1y τ

Hence joy enchants the woods, and smiling plains,
Pales and Pan, the Dryads‚ and the swains ς

No more the prowling wolf the cattle fear, 70
Nor secret toils deceive th’ incautious deer3

54. Ο bard divina] The elegance and sweetness of these
iines are not to be equalled by any thing, but the answer Mop-
sus makes to them afterwards in line 82 of the original.

Nam neque me tantum, &c-
