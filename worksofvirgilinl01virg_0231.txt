Book 1. THE Gi-:oaoxcs or VIRGIL. 199

' But blush not fattening dung to cast around‚

Or sordid ashes o’er th' exhausted ground.
Thus rest, or change of grain, improves the field, 100
Thus riches may arise from lands untill’d.
Gainful to burn the barren glebe 'tis found,
While the light stubble, crackling‚ flames around z

„ Whence, or to earth new stores of strength are lent,

And large supplies of richer nutriment; 105

Or oozing off, and purify'd by fise, ’

The latent, noxious particles transpire3

Or thro' the pores relax'd‚ the tendes blade

Fresh frucstifying juices feels convey'd 3

Or genial heat the hollow glebe constrains, 110

Braces each nerve‚ and brinds the gaping veins ;

Lest ssender showers‚ or the fierce bearns of day,

Or Boreas' baleful cold should scorch the crops away.
NIuch too he helps his labour'd lands‚ who breaks

The crumbling clods, with harrows, drags, and rakes; 1 15

Who ploughs across, and back, with ceaseless mil,

Subdues to dust, and triumphs o'er the soil ε

Plenty to him, industrious swain ἔ is giv'n‚

And ,Ceres smiles upon his works from heav’n.

pherS. Aristotle says, that cold is accidentally an affive body,
and is sometimes said to burn and warm, not in the same man-
ner as hear, but because it condenses or constrains the heat by
surrounding it. MARTYN.
116. Who ploughs across.] What the poet speaks of here re-
tains the Roman name to this day, in many parts of England ς
and is called, sowing upon the back3 that is, sowing stiff
ground after once ploughing. Now, says virgil, he that
draws a harrow or hurdle over his ground before he sows it,
multum juvat arva, for this fills up the chinks‚ which other-
wise would bury the corn ; but then, says he, “ Ceresffraiways
looks kindly on him, who ploughs his ground aeros} again.’'

119. And Ceres.] Virgil, says Spence, in his Georgics gives
us an idea of Ceres as regarding the laborious husbandman
from heaven, and bleffing the work of his hand with success.
There is a pisture like this in- the famous old manuscript of
virgil in the vatican ; and Lucretius has a strong descriptionf
