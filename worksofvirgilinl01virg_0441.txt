DIDACTIC POETRY. 405

pompous epithets‚ studied phrases, and high-flown meta-
phors‚ into the mouths of his charaEters. But as the didac-
tic poet speaks in his own person, it is neceffary and proper
for him to use a more luscious colouring of style, and to
be more studious of ornament. And this is agreeable to
an admirable precept of Aristotle, which no writer in any
kind of composition, be it prose or poetry‚ should ever
that difflon ought most to be laboured in the
unaffive, that is, the descriptive parts of the poem, in
which the opinions, manners'and paffions of men are not
represented; for too glaring an expreffion obscures the

Accordingly Virgil hath used every poffible method of
exalting his style into dignity and grace, by bold meta·
phors, grecisrns, striking epithets‚ and poetical circum-
locutions.

Hence it is that he will not say quo tempore, but spdere,

dimus aequor for ploughing, and Saturni dente for the
pruning hook. Hence is it that he ascribes human pro-
perties and paffions to plants and animals.

And in his needy {hop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuft, and other skins
Of ill-{hap’d fishe33 and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes ;
Green earthen-pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses,
'Were thinly scatter'd to make up a shew.

1 appeal to those who know any thing of the human beart,
whether Romeo in this distressful situation, could have leisure
to think of the alligator, empty boxes, and bladders, and other
furniture of this beggarly shop, and to point them out so dis-
tinffly to the audience. The description is indeed very lively
and natural, but very improperly put into the mouth of a per-
sdn agitated with such paffion as Romeo is represented to be.
