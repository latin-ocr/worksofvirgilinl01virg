THE LIFE OF VIRGIL. '19‘

Caesars. That poem therefore may very well be confi-
dered as a work merely political. If this was the case,
virgil was not so highly encouraged by Augustus and
Maecenas for nothing. To speak a little more plainly ; he
wrote in the service of the new usurpation on the state 5
and all that can be offered in vindication of him in this
light is, that the usurper he wrote for was grown a tame
one 3 and that the temper and bent of their constitution
was such,¹ that the reins of government must have fallen
into the hands of some one person or another3 and might
probably, on a new revolution, have fallen into the
hands of some one less mild and indulgent, than Augus-

services But whatever may be said of his reasons for
writing it, the poem itself has been highly applauded in
all ages, from its first appearance to this day; and tho’
left unfiniffied by its author, has been always reckoned as
much superior to all other epic poems among the Ro-

and gives us the forms and appearances of their deities
as strongly, as if we had so many pi<9tures of them pre-
served to us, done by some of the best hands in the Au-

some of the ancients themselves, for the strength of his
imagination, as to this particular 3 tho’ in general that is
not his charai'oer, so much as exaerness. He was cer-

aH false thoughts and idle ornaments in writing were
discouraged : And it is as certain, that there is but little
of invention in his AEneid3 much less, I believe, than is
j generally imagined. Almost all the little facits in it are

ῗ built on history: and even as to particular lines, no one

perhaps ever borrowed more from the poets that preceded.
