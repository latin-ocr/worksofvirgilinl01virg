Book 3. THE Geoamcs OF Vincit.. 293

’ In the mid dome shall Caesar’s form divine
Superior stand the godhead of the shrine.

Cunila mihi, Alpheum linquens &cosp-ue Molorchi,
Cusfibus et crudo decernet Graecia caestu.

To see the propriety of thefigure in this place, the reader needs
only be reminded of the book ofgames in ,the Aeneid, which
was. purposely introduced in honour of the emperor, aud not,
as is commonly thought, for a mere trial of {kil} between the
poet and his master. The emperor was paffionately fond of
these spor-ts, and was even the author or restorer of one os them.
It is not to be doubted, that he allodes also to the qm'nquennial
gamas, aftually celebrated, in honour of his temple3‚ through
many parts of the empire. And this the poet undertakes in
Ι the civil office of vrCTOR.

2. What follows is in the relzgious office of Parsss’r. For
· it is to be noted, that, in assuming this double charaeta, which
the decorum of the solemnium, here recounted, prescribed,
the poet has an eye to the politisal defigo of the Aeneis, which
was to do honour to Caesar, in either capacityof a civil aud re-
ligious personage3 both being effential to the idea of the per-
se& legissator, he was to adorn and recommend. The account
‘of his sacerdotal fundions is delivered in these words:

Ipfi’ caput tonsae foliis ornatus olivae
Donaferam. jam nunc fhllemm's ducere pompas
Ad delubra juvat, caqsosque videre juvencos .-
V el scaena ut versis discedat fivntilms 3 utque
Purpurea intexti tollant aulaea Britanni.

The imagery in this place cannot be understood, without re-
flefiing on the customary form and dispoficion ef the pagan
temples. Βειυεκυω, or DELUDRA‚ for either member is
used indifferently, denotes the shrine, or sancluary, whereiu
the statue of the pijefiding God was placed. This was in the
center of the building. Exaffly before the delubrum, and at
no great distance from it, was the ALTAR. Further, the
smine, or delubrum, was inclosed, and snut up on all fides by
deors of curio-as carved work, and dustile veils, embellisned 'oy
the rich embroidery of flowers, anmals, or humcmfigures. This
being observed, the progress of the imagery before us will be
this. The procefi'ion ad delubra, or shrine ε the sacrifice on the
altius, created before it: and, last}y‚ the painted, or rather
wroughtstenerjy of the purple veih, inclosmg the image, which
were oruamented, and seemed to be sustained or held up by
the figures of inwoven Britons. The meaning of all which
is, that the poet would proceed to the celebration of Caesar’s
“ praise in all the gradual, solemn preparation of poetic pomp :
that he would render the most grateful affierings to his dirixiify
