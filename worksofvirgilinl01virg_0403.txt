· Book-4. , Tm: GEoR‘chs 'or Vnum.

And when with sudden ssight the ΗΠ] she leaves,
‘Descending penfive to the wintry waves.

Fierce rage and choler in their bosoms glow,
With venom’d stings they dart upon their foe,
Their subtle poison creeps the veins around,

In sweet revenge they die upon the wound.

-. a‘But if in winter bleak, their broken state, .
And drooping spirits you commiseram,

Who doubts, regar-dtu} of the pinching time,
To fumigate their hives with fragrant ffiyme, x
And pare their empty wax ? The lizard lurks,
Or ssozv-pac'd beetle in their inmost workS,

Or oft their golden hoards the fat drones.spoil,
A sace that riots on.an0ther's toil;

Or the fierce hornet, founding dire alarms‚
Provokes the lab'rers to unequal arms ;

.Or baneful moths, or fiae whom Pallas 'hates,

· Suspends her filmy nets before their gates.

The more they lose, the more with ceaseless care,

They strive the state’s destruetion to repair3

Their plunder’d wealth and wasted combs renew, ’

And swell their granaries with thicken’d dew.
But when, as human ills descend to bees,
The pining nation labours with disease3
Chang’d is their glittering hue to ghastly pale,
Roughness and leannesso'er their limbs prevail 3
forth the dead citizens with grief are borne,
In solemn state the sad attendants mourn.
Clung by the feet they hang the live-long day
Around the door, or in their chambers stay,
Hunger and cold and grief their toils delay.
’Tis then in hoarser tones their hums resound,
Like hollow winds the rustling forest round,
Or billows breaking on a distant shore3

Or ,flames in furnaces that inly roar.
