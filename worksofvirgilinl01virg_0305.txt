Disdaining bonds, all free, and full of life,
Ὀ dare not wound too soon with sharpen’d knife ἔ
. Infert your bending finger8‚ gently cull
The roving shoots, and red’ning branches pull ε
But when they clasp their elms with strong embraee, 443
'Lop the luxuriant boughs‚ a lawless race3
Ere this, they dread the stee13 now, now, reclairn
The flowing branches, the bold Wand'rers tame.
Guard, too, from cattle thy new-planted ground,
And infant-vines that ill can bear a wound : 450·
For not alone by winter's chilling frost,
Or summer's scorching bearn the young are Iost3
But the ‹csssd buffaloes and greedy cow8‚
= And goats and sportive kids the branches browze ;
Not piercing coms, nor Sirius' beams that beat 435
On the pareht hius, and split their tops with heat,
So deeply injure, as the nibbling flocks,
’'That wound with venom'd teeth the tender, fearful stocks.>
Hence is the goat on Bacchus’ altar laid,
Hence on ‘the Iofty stage are fables play’d. 460
'Th' Athenians first to rival wits decreed,
In streets and villages the poet²s meed3
The feast with mirth and foaming goblets kept,
And on the goat-{kin bladders rudely leapt.
Nor less th’ Ausonian swains deriv'd from Troy, 465
Sport in rough numbers and unwieldy joy ς»
Their hollow vizards scoop from barks of trees,
And stain their ghastIy masks with purple lees 3
Bacchus, on thee they call, in hymns divine,
And hang thy statues on the lofty pine : 472
