Neptune5 et cultor nemorum, cui pinguia Ceae

Ter centum nivei tondent³durneta juvenci t 15
Ipse nemus linquens patrium saltusque Lycaei>

Pan ovium custos, tua fi tibi NIaenala curae,

Adfis ὃ Tegeaee favens, oleaeque Minerva

Inventrix, uncique puer monstrator aratri,

Et teneram ab radice ferens, Silvane, cupressum ε 20 ,

Dique deaeque omnes, studium quibus arva tueri,
Qique novas alitis non ullo semine fruges:

Qique satis largum coelo demittitis imbrem.

Tuqiie adeo, quern- mox quae sint habitura deorum
Concilia incertum est3 urbisne invisere, Caesar, 25
Terrarumque velis curam, et te maximus orbis
Auemrem frugum,v tempestatumque potentem

' Accipiat, ‚cingens materna tempora myrto;

An 'deus immensi venias maris, ac tua nautae

Numina ‘sola colant: tibi serviat ultima Thule, 30
Teque fibi generum Tethys emat omnibus undis ε

about naming Athens, Neptune struck the earth with his tri-
dent, and produced a horse, and Pallas an olive tree.

19. Iffcaeus’grove] Lycaeus and Maenalus were two moun·
taius in Arcadia, sacred to Pan.

25· Sylvanus.] Medals represent Sylvanus bearing a young
cypress tree torn up by the reots. Neither Mr. Dryden nor
Mr. Benson seem apprehensive of this allusion, which is very

pieturesque.
31. And thora] The poet here begins a fine address to Au-

gustus, asking him whether he would chuse to be the god of ’

earth, sea, or heaven. Catrou ingeniously imagines this ad·
dress was added by Virgil the year before his death, when se-
veral other passages were likewise inserted3 for he says Augus-
tus was not thus highly honoured till after his return from the
conquest of Egypt.

40. Scorpius] Libra, or the instance, was originally re-

'presented as held up by Scorpius, who extended his claws Ifor
