Ecl. 1. THE ’Ecmomzs oF Vmon„ 85⁹

No more, as in my verdant cave I lie,

shall I behold ye hang from rocks on high:

No more ihall tend yet, while ye round me browse

The trefoil fiow'rs, or willow's harsher boughs. 100
TITYRUS.

Yet here, this night, at least, with me reclin'd

On the green leaves, an humble welcome find3

Ripe apples, chesnuts sofr, my fields afford,

And cheese in plenty loads my rural board.

And see ! from village-tops the smoke ascend, ¹05

And falling ssmdes from western hills extend.

END oF THE FIRST ECLOGUE.
