428 'REFLECTIONS oN‘

the F rench after >their manner boast so highly ; who is a
feeble and flegmatic poet, and hath filled his work, under
the notion of digreffiom, with many puerile and extra-
vagant fames, th'e Caricatura’s of Ovid 3 'whose idle
turns and witticisms he hath likewise frequently imitated.

form of a garden which Virgil gives us about the middle

address to his intimate friend Triffino‚ the author of that
cool and infipid epic poem, Italia Liberata; but whose
