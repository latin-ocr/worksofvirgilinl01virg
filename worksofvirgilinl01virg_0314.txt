280 P. VIRGILII MARoms GEORGICA. Lib. 2.¹

¹ 'saygeta3 ὃ, qui me gelidis in vallibus Haemi

fimat, et ingenti ramorum protegat umbra!

Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere caussas : 490
Atque metus omnis et inexorabile fatum

Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari!
Fortunatus et ille, deos qui novit agrestis,

Panaque, Silvanumque senem, Nymphasque sorores!
Illum non populi fasces, non purpura regum , 495
flexit, et infidos agitans discordia fratres;

Aut conjurato descendens Dacus ab Histro :

Non res Romanae, perituraque regna. neque ille

Aut doluit miserans inopem, aut invidit habenti.

Q1os rami fruetus, quos ipsa volentia rura 500
Sponte tulere sua, carpsit : nec ferrea jura,

Insanumque forum, aut populi tabularia vidit.
Sollicitant alii remis freta caeca, ruuntque

In serrum3 penetrant aulas, et limina regum:

Hic petit excidiis urbem, miserosque penatis, 505
Ut gemma bibat, et Sarrano indormiat ostro.

Condit opes alius, defossoque incubat auro,

things, that would be proper enough for a Greek, but found
quite improper from a Roman. Virgil's and Horaee’s instanc-
ing Thrace, as so very cold a country, is a strong proof of this.
Thrace was full north of Greece, and some of the Greeks
therefore might talk of the coldness of that country as strongly,
perh-aps, as some among us talk of the coldness ofScotland. The
Roman writers (peak just in the same stile of the coldness of
Thrace, tho' a considerable part of ltaly lay in as northern a
latitude‚ and some ofit even farther north than Thrace.

(04. Happy the mam] These noble lines are undoubtedly a
cont-‘piiment' to Lucretius, to whose poem Virgil is much in-
debted, and whose system must lead him to despise the fears
of death and hell: how strongly and poetically is the latter
particular expreffed by the roaring (din or noise) of the infer-
'nal river Acheron l .
