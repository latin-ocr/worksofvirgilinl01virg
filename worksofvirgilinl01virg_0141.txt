PALAEMON.
Which to prefer perplexing doubts arise: 155
Neither have won, but both deserv’d the prize3
And all deserve alike, whose song can prove,
Like yours, how much they fear’d or hop'd in love.
’Tis time to cease, my boys : the streams restrain,
Enough the floods have drench'd the thirsty plain. 160
