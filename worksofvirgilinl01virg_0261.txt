Book 1. Tm: GsscRmcs OF Vnum„ 227

Not that to them a genius Heav’n hath lent,
Or piercing forefight of each dark event,
But when the changeful temper of the fines,
The rare condenses, the dense rarifies‚ 490
New motions on the alter'd air imprest,
New images and paffions fill their breast:
Hence the glad birds in louder concert join,
Hence croaks th' exulting rook, and sport the lusty kine.
But if thou {halt observe the mpid sun,- 495

And mark the moons their following courses run, '
No night serene with smiles, shall e'er betray‚
And safely may'st thou trust the coming day z
When the young moon returning light eollecf'cs‚
If 'twixt her horns we spy thick gloomy speckS, 500>
Prepare‚ ye mariners and watchful swains,
For wasteful storms and deluges of rains ἔ
But if a virgin-blufh her cheeks o’erspread‚
Lo, winds l they tinge her golden face with red;

l But the fourth evening if she clearly nse, 505
And fail unclouded thro' the azure skies,
That day, and all the following month behind,
No rattling storm shall feel of rain or wind ι
And sailors sav’d from the devouring sea,
To Glaucus vows prefer and Panope. 510
Nor less the sun„ when eastern hills he leaves,
And when he smks behind the blushing waves,
Prognostics gives ε he brings the safest signs

v At morn, and when the starry evening {hines ε
When with dark spots his opening face he clouds, 515
Shorn of his beaune, and half his glory shrouds,

meant it so, by what he says of it. If this be the true reading,
it may be thus understood.-“ If on the fourth day of the new
moon, its WHoLE Dm< appears, and the horns of that part of
it which is enlighten’d, are {hai-p, and well-pointed ; then the
next day, and all the following to the end of the mouth, will
be free both from-high winds and rain.'' Honnswpa‘ru.
