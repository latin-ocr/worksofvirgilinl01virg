ECLOGUE THE NINTH.

ARGUMENT.

We are tcld by Ser-vius that sMoeris is the person who had

the care ⁶f Virgil’ssarm‚ was his procurator, cr bailiff}
. as we speak at present3 and that when ¹Virgil hadfivm
Augzfius received α grant cf his lands, one Arrius α cen-
turion refused to admit him into pffffon‚ and would cer-
tainly have killed him ²f Virgil had notsaved his li e by
swimming over the [Mincius. ‘This accident is mentioned in
this Eclogue. Lycidas overtakes Moeris on his way to
Rome, and asks him to ,repeat to l];'m as they paffid along
some favourite verfl’;·‚ that he formerly had heard from

- Ι him. Moeris grants his 7·equss‚ but suddenly breaks off

in a natural and dramatis manner.
