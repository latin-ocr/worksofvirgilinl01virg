18 THE LIFE OF VIRGIL.

Carthage, by the spirit of his departed father ; AEn. iv.
ver. 351. And lastly, by the great meffenger of the
chief of all their gods,

Ascanium surgentem ὅ spes haeredis Iiili
Restm-5³3 cui regnum Italiae Romanaque tellus
Debentur

 

 

AEn. iv. ver. 275.

He shews likewise that he was made king of it by the
will of Heaven, and by all the human rights that could
be. Viz. he has an hereditary claim from Dardanus and
Jafius, AEn. iii. ver. 168.-He has a right by conquest,
AEn. xii. ver. 1.-He has a right by compaeh AEn. xii.
ver. 175 to 225.—And he has a right by marrying the
only daughter of the then king, AEn. xii. ver. 937. and
AEn. vii. ver. 50—52. He shews likewise that there
was an uninterrupted succeffion of kings from him to
Romulu83 that his heirs were to reign there for ever3'
and that the Romans under them were to obtain the
monarchy of the world. It appears from Virgil, and the
other Roman writers, that Julius Caesar was of this royal
race 3 and that Augustus was his sole heir. The natural
result of all this is, that the promises made to the Roman
people, in and through this race, terminating in Augus-
tus; the Romans, if they would obey the gods, and be
masters of the world, were to yield obedience to the new
establishment under that prinee. As odd a scheme as this
may seem now, it is scarce so odd as that of some people
among us, who persuaded themselves that an absolute
obedience was owing to our kings, on their supposed de-
sccnt from some unknown Patriarch. And yet that had
its effe& with many about a century ag05 and seems not to
hav<- quite lost all its influence, even in our remembrance.

However that bc, I think it appears plain enough that ¹

the two great points aimed at by Virgil in his AEneid,
were to maintain their old religious tenets; and to sup-
port the new form of governxnent, in the family of the

3 Caesars.
