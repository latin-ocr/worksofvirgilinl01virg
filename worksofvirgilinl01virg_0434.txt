'tinguifloes poetry from prose, and makes Virgil’s rules'
'of husbandry pleasanter to‘read than Varro’s. Where
the prose writer tells us plainly what ought to hedone,-
the poet often conceals the precept in the description,
‘and represents his country-man performing the ad’tion in
which he would instruet his reader. Where the one sets
'out as fully and distimffly as he can, all the parts of vthe
‘truth which he Worild communicate to us, the other fingles
out the most pleafing circumstance of this trutli, ands'o
conveys 'the whole in amore diverting manner to the
understanding.' ’

The delicateaddress of Virgil in thiswparticulaf '1's
worth our attention '3 of which the following instances
may be given. Instead of'telling his husbandman plain-2
ly, that his cro‘ps will fail ‘by' bad management3 vhe says,

Heu magnum alterius frzssra spefflabis acervum,
Concufflquefamem in sylvis solabere quercu.

“Instead of saying‚ that elms'by engrafting have borne

acorns, he speaks of that operation in this lively manner τ’
--- ‘Glandemque sues fregere sub ulmis.

Instead of , informing us that the farmers often root up an
old forest, he adorns this proceeding with the following
pickuresque circumstances :

Antiqua-sque domos avium cumstirpz'bus imis
Eruit 3 illae altum nidis petiere relifflis.

’He does not call the plane-a large tree, but says,
Jamque ministrantem platanum potantibus umbram.

And instead of ordering the farmer to water his grounds„

what a landscape does he present us with l Δ

Ecce, supercilio clivosi tramitis undam
Elicit : illa cadens raucum pcr laevia murmur
Saxa ciet, scatebrisque arentia temperat arva!

After this manner should the didastie poet raise and
enliven every precept he gives3 he should turn rules into
