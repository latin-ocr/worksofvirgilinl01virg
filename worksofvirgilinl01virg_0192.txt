1¹62 P. VIRGILn MARONIS Bucoch. Ecl. 8.

Carmina vel coelo poffunt deducere lunam:

Carminibus Circe socios mutavit Ulixi: 70
Frigidus in pratis cantando rumpitur anguis.

Ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daphnin.
Terna tibi hacc primum triplici diversa colore

Licia circumdo, terque haec altaria circum

Effigiem duco. numero deus inpare gaudet. 75
Ducite ab urbe domum, rnea carmina, ducite Daphnin.
Necte tribus nodis rernm, Amarylli, colores :

Necte, Amarylli, modo : et, Veneris, dic, vincula necto.
Ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daphnin.
Limus ut hic durescit, et haec ut cera liquescit 80
Uno eodemque igni3 fic nostro Daphnis amore.

Sparge molam, et fragilis incende bitumine lauros.
Daphnis me malus urit t ego hanc in Daphnide laurum.
Ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daphnin.
Talis amor Daphnin, qualis, cum feffa juvencum 85
Per nemora atque altos quaerendo bucula lucos,

Propter aquae rivom viridi procumbit in ulva

Perdita, nec serae meminit decedere 11οᾶὶί 2

94. For three] The ancients had a prodigious veneration foiv
the number three, and held many ridiculous superstitions in re· ’
lation to it. This number was thought the most perfect of all
numbers, having regard to the beginning, middle, and end.

103. As this samefire.] There were plainly two figures
made, one of wax, and the other of clay; the former would
naturally mest, and the other harden by the fire. The notion ,
was, that as the image consumed, so did the person it repress ’
sented. Dr. Martyn observes, that in the beginning of the
last century, many persons were convifited of this and other ²*
such like practices, and were executcd accordingly, as it was
deemed to be attempting the lives of others. King james the
First was a great believer of the power of magic, and wrote
a very idle book on the subject, eutituled, Daemonologie. ¹
Shakespear seems to have chosen the subjc& of his Macbeth to
please the taste of that prince. .

The bays were burnt also to consume the flesti of the person
on whose account these magical rites were performed. Thev

Vtsske is ¹crumbled upon the image of Daphnis as upon the vietim. r
