Ecl. 4. THE EcLootn-:s 01- Vmon„ υς

Of native purple and unborrow'd gold,

⁸ And sandyx clothe with red the crowded'fold. 50
The Sisters to their spindles said———“ Sueceed,

Ye happy years3 for thus hath fate decreed f

Assume thy state ! thy destin'd honours prove,

Dear to the gods l Ο progeny of Jove !

Behold how tottering nature nods around, 55
Earth, air, the wat'ry waste, and heav'n prolound !

At once they change———they wear a smiling face,

And all with joy th' approaching age embrace ,¹

O that my life, my vigour may remain

To tell thy actions in heroic strain; 60
Not Orpheus' self, not Linus should exceed
My losty lays, or gain the poet's meed,
Tho' Phoebus, tho' Calliope inspire,

And one the mother aid, and one the fire.
Should Pan contend, Arcadia's self ssmuld own 65
That I from Pan himself had gain'd the crown.

Begin, begin, O loveliest babe below l

Thy mother by her tender smile to know!

to be succoured by this new-born hero. But that to others
seems not to agree with the happiness which is ascribed even to λ,
the first division, and to the beginning of this happy age.
And therefore they say, it either nods, i. e. moves and shakes
· itself with joy and exultation3 which is pretty harsh to my
apprehension ; or, which is not much better, inclines and tends
to another, i. e. a yet more happy state3 vergentem, say they,
nutantemque in melioremstatum. After all I like the first inter-
pretation best. 'Twas good sense to say, the world at present
,labours with its guilt and misery: but yet rejoices at the very
near prospe& of the happy change, which is in a manner begun
alread r.

68.)Tl2y mother by her tender smile.] The commentators are
divided in opinion,⁴ whether he means the smile of the child,
or that of the mother. I choose the latter meaning, as it may
be supported by the best reasons. See Rufinus, and ERY-
THRAEus.
