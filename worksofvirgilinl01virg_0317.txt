Book 2· '1⁷³2 Gsoaozcs 01²· Vmou..

One doats with fondness on the rostrum's fame,
To gain the prize of eloquence, his aim:

'she people’s and patrician's loud applause,

To crowded theatres, another draws ;

Some shed a'brother’s blood, and trembling run
To distant lands, beneath another sun;
Condemn’d in hopeless exile far to roam

From their sweet country, and their sacred home.
'The happier peasant yearly ploughs the plains,
His country hence, his houshold hence sustains 3
His milky droves, his much—deserving steers :
Eaeh season brings him, in the circling years,
Or blushing apples, or increase of kine,

Or bursts his barus with Ceres' gifts divine.
Prest are his Sicion olives in the mills,

His swine with fat'ning mast the forest stus,

In winter wild : and yellow autumn crowns
With various fruits his farms and smiling grounds,
While every rocky mountain’s sunny fide

The melting grapes with livid ripeness hide.

He feels the father’s and the husoand’s huss,

His infants climb‚ and struggle for a kiss 3

His modest house stri& chastity maintains,

Nor breach of marriage-vows his nuptials stains 3
Fat are the kine, with milk o'er-flow the pails,
His kids in sportive battles skim the vales :

The jocund master keeps the solemn days,

To thee, great Bacchus, due libations pays ;
Around the chearful hearth unbends his foul,
And crowns amid his friends the flowing bowl ;
Distributes prizes to the strong-nerv’d swains.
Who best can dart οι· wrestle on the plains.
The frugal Sabinos thus their acres till'd‚

r Thus Remus and his brother lov‘d the field t
