Ec‘i. 2. THE Eczoousss or Vnum.

Wretch that Ι am! to the tempestuous blast
Ο Ι have given my blooming flowers to waste!

Whom dost thou fly ? the gods of heav'n above,
And Trojan Paris deign’d in woods to rove;
Let Pallas build, and dwell in lofty towers,
Be our delight the fields and shady bowers:
Lions the wolves‚ and wolves the kids pursue,
The kids sweet thyme——and I still follow you.
Lo Ι labouring oxen spent with toil and heat,
In loosen’d traces from the plough retreat,
The sun is scarce above the mountains seen,
Lengthening the {hadows o'er the dusky green 3
But still my bosom feels not evening cool,

ζ’ Love reigns uncheck'd by time, or bounds‚ or rule.

²,What frenzy‚ Corydon, invades thy breast ,Ρ
Thy elms grow wild, thy vineyard lies undrest;
Ϊ No more thy necessary labours leave,
· Renew thy works, and oster-baskets weave :

If this Alexis treat thee with disdain,

Thou’lt find another, and a kinder swain.

END OF THE SECOND ECLOGUE.
