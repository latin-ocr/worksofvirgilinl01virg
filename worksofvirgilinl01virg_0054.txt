'24' THE LIFE :OF VIRGIL.

the poet intimates‚ that when he returns from Greece he
would perfect and publish his AEneid: for this is the
superb temple he intends to ere& in honour of Augustus,

The emperor was the chief divinity of the temple3 his
ancestors were all to have their statues εῑεέεᾶ m it, (that
is) were to be the principal αᾶὶοῑε 1n the AEneid3 and his
victories, like Basso Relievos, were to adorn the glorious
work. CATROU was the first who hit of this interpre-
tation, which adds an infinite beauty to the paffage.

Nature seems to kase thought, that for one person to
have produced two perfect poems, would have been too
great a portion of fame and felicity for humani Ity to en-
joy. Augustus, returning vicff'torious from the East, met
with Virgil at Athens, who thought himself obliged to
wait upon the emperor back to Italy. But he was sud-
denly seized with a fatal distemper, which, being in-
creased by the agitation of the veffel, he had scarce time
to land at Brundusium, where he died on the twenty-
second day of September, in the fifty-second year of his
age. What can give one so high an opinion, both of
his modesty and genius, as his earnestl'y requesting on his
death—bed, that his AEneid might be burin, because it
had not received his last correctione and improvements!
which, to speak the truth, thelast fix books apparently
want. But Mr. Upton is of opinion, that he ordered
his divinework to be destroyed, not because it wanted
perfefiion as an epic poem, but because it flattered the
subvertor of the constitution.

Tully says somcwhat severely, Adhuc neminem cognovi
poetam, qui fibi non optimus videretur. Tuscul. lib. 1.
J never yet knew any poet, who did not think himfi’lf the best
cf his prcfiffion. This sarcasm can be applicable to
none but those trifling wite, who owe their complacency
