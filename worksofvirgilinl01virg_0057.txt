‚THE LIFE OF viRGIL. ἑ,

that coming once into the theme, the whole audience
rose out of respe& to him. His voice was mufical, and
his elocution marvelloussy proper, and pathetic. He
was of a thoughtful and melancholy temper, spoke little,
and loved retirement and contemplation, and was an
enemy to those talkative impertinents, from which no
court (not even that of Augustus) could be free. He
had a heart full of tenderness and senfibility‚ and formed
for all the delicate feelings of love and friendssiip. His
fortune was not only easy, but affluent: he had a de-
lightful villa in Sicily, and a fine house and well-fur-
nished library neaqMaecenas’s gardens on the Esquiline
hill at Rome.

But ah ! Maecenas is yelad in clay,

And great Augustus long ygo is dead,
And all the worthies liggen wrapt in lead,
That matter made for poets on to play:

says an exquifite poet, who wanted such encouragement
as Virgil met with, and who adds, in a noble strain,

ἶ that, if he had been encouraged,

ᾗ Thou kenst not, Percie, how the rime should tage&
’ Ο if my temples were distain'd with wine,
ξ And gift in girlonds of wild ivy-twine,
¹ How I could rear the muse on stately stage,
And teach her tread aloft in buskin fine,
Ξ With queint Bellona in her equipage!
ξ ’ Spenser’s O&ober.

juvenal says finely, that we should have wanted the
ἱ strongest paintingS, the noblest strokes of imagination in
{211 the AEneid, if virgil had not been bless’d with the
ᾗ comforts and conveniencies of life.
