Book r. Tine. Gssoaoxcs oF VIRGIL. 197*

Here golden corn, there luscious grapes ahmam,

There grass spontaneous, or rich fruits are found3 'je
See'st thou not Tmolus, saffron sweet dispense ?

Her ivory,⁴ Ind ? Arabia, frankincense?

The naked Chalybes their iron ore ?
To Castor Pontus give it's fetid pow'r ?

While for Olympic garnes, Epirus broeds, 75 ’

To whirl the kindling car, the swiftest steeds ?

Nature, these laws, and these eterna} hands,

First fix'd on certain elimes, and various lands,

W'hat time the stone5‚ upon th’ unpeopled world,
Whence sprung laborious man, Deucslion hurl'd. 80
¹Come on then ; yoke, and sweat thy sturdy steer,

In deep, rich soils, when dawns the vernal year3

The turf dlsclos’d, the clinging clods unbound,
*Summer {hall bake and meliorate thy ground :

. But for light, steril land, it may suffice, 85
Gently to turn it in autumnal ss<ies3

There, lest the wecds o’er joyful ears prevail‚

Here, lest all moisture frorn the sands exhale.

The glebe {hall rest, whence last you gather'd grain,

- Til] the spent earth recover strength again ; 90

For where the trembling pods of pulse you took,

Or from its rattling stall< the lupin shook,

Or vetches' seed minute, will golden corn

With alter'd grain that happy tilth adom.

Parcht are the lands, that oats or flax produce, 95
vOr poppies‚ pregnaut with Lethean julce3 }
Nor want uncultur'd fallows grace or use.

'Tis but a very infipid thing at best. Thefafi’lus of the Romans
is our lupin. Hornswoarn.

93. Parcht are the lancis] That flax, oats, and poppies‚ dry

and iranverish the soil, we have the concurrent testimony of

Columella, Paladius‚ and Pliny. The Romans cultivated

poppies, not our common lcarlet oneS‚ but our garden poppy.
