Ecl. 62 Tur. Ecto‘cu'ris οἳ νικοη, 139

Who, as the god uplifts his drowzy eyes,

With berries’ purple juice his temples dies. 30
Pleas’d with the fraud-‘⁶ Unloose me, boys‚’' he cry'd‚
‘⁶ Enough‚ that by surprize I've been espy’d.

“ Attend‚ ye youths, and hear the promis'd lay,

ἕ( But Aegle shall be paid a better way.'’

Soon as he rais’d his voice, the list’ning fanus, 35
,And wondering beasts carne dancing down the lawns3
The hills exusted, and each rigid oak, ι’
High-seated en their tops, in trans port shook3
Parnaffus' cliffs did ne'er so much rejoice‚

At the sweet echoes of Apollo’s voice 3 ‘40
Nor Rhodope nor Ismarus that heard

The magic warblings of the Thracian bard.

, He sung, at universal nature's birth,

How seeds of water, fire, and air, and earth,

Fell thro' the void3 whence order rose, and all 45
The beauties of this congregated ball :

How the moist soil grew stiffen'd by degoees,

And drove to destin‘d bounds the narrow'd seas 3

How Earth was seiz’d with wonder and affright,

Struck with the new-born sun's refulgent light. 50
How clouds condens'd‚ in liquid showers distill’d,

Dropt fatness and refreffiment on the field 3

How first up-springs sublime each branching grove,
While seatter’d beasts o’er pathless mountains rove.
Next to the world's renewal turns the strain, 55
To Pyrrha's fruitful stones, and Saturn’s reign3

And bold Prometheus’ theft and punishment,

His mangled heart by angry vultures rent.

58. His mangled beart by hungqy vultures rent] This tale has
been prettily allegorized. It is an ingenious but cruel story
which the poets have contrived to express the train of cares
brought into life by Prometheus or Forefight: The chains
which fastened him to the rock, and the insatiable vulture that
sends his vitals every morning.
