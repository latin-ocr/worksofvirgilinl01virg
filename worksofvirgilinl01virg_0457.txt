DIDACTIC POETRY. 42¹

had any of the force and fire of Lucretius, whom he has
endeavoured to answer: his arguments are indeed strong,
but he has not a spark of poetry: his versification is

have stood in need of such an instructor, for they had no
extraordinary talents or taste for the stage. In comoedzd
