Book 2. THE Gssonmcs or Vmcu. 265

‘Mars sternly stalks each equal front betwixt‚ 350

Nor yet the fate of either host is fixt t

Ev'n thus, your vines dispos’d at distance due,

Not only strike with joy the gazer’s view,

But earth more equal nutriment supplies,

The plants find space to spread, and vigorous rise. 355
Perhaps the depth of trenches you’ll demand ς

The vine I dare to plant in shallow land3

But forest-trees that rear their branches higher,

A deeper mold, and wider room require:

Chief the tall Aesculus, that tow'rs above 360

Each humbler tree, the monarch of the grove 3

High as his head stioots lofty to the fkies,

So deep his root in hell's foundation lies;

While storms and wintry blasts and driving rain

Beat fiercely on his stately top in vain 3 365

Unhurt, unmov'd, he stands in hoary state,

For many an age beyond frail mortals' date.

This way and that, his vast arms widely spread,

He in the midst supports the thick-surrounding ssiade.

Nor let thy vineyards to the west decline 3 37⁶

Nor hazles plant amid the joyous vine3

No scions pluck a-top, but near the roots 3

Nor wound with blunted steel the red’ning shoots;

Nor let wild olives (noxious plants !) be found

Nigh to those spots where luscious grapes aboundt 375

For oft from heedless {hepherds falls a spark,

Which lurking first beneath the une'tuous bark,

Seizes the solid tree 3 with dreadful roar

The flames thro' catching leaves and branches soar,

Swift thro’ the crackling wood triumphant fly, 380

And hur] the pitchy clouds into the darken'd sky.

But most they ravage, if the roaring wind ’

With doubled rage should rise, with fire combin'd ς

376. Fallsqspark.] This fine description of a fire raging

among the vines and their supporters, judicioussy relieves the
dryness of the Didaetic lines preceding.
