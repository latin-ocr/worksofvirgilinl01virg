PREFATORY Dtmcxmort. xiii

Virgil' is free both from the streamer, and this
faulty mixture 3 so also is Pitt;

Now on her car was gay Aurora borne,
And Ocean reddens with the rifing morn. Pitt, 31.

3. Tum quorum attonitae Baccho nemora avia matres
Insultant thiasis, (neque enim leve nomen Amatae)

Undique collati coeunt, Martemque fatigant.
AEn. 7. 582.

In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear,
And lead his dances with diffievell’d hair, ’
Increase the clamour, and the war demand—-

-Dryden, 803.

Then they, whose mothers frantie with their sear, }

As he had before given a streames to Aurora, he
here gives flags to the attendants of Bacchus 3

Those too whose mothers by the queen were led,
When fir'd by Bacchus, to the woods {he fied,

(Such was her int’rest in the realm) declare
For open arms, and breathe revenge and war.

Pin, 735.

4. Cybele in another place is drawn by the tygers
of Bacchus instead of her own lion&

Alma parens Idaea dedm, cui Dindyma cordi,
Turrigeraeque urbes, bijugique ad fraena leones.
AEn. 10. 2 5 3.

Hear thou, great mother of the deities,
With turrets cro-‚vn'd‚ on Ida’s holy hill,
. Fierce tygers rein’d and curb’d, obey thy will.
Dryden, 356.
