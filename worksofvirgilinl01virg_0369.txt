’ And first the father of· che meating crowd,

FIoats with his moffieffd fleece along theflood t 55'0

Or bathe their limbs· iri bitter lees of oil,

With bubbles th‘at from‘ molten¹ filver boi·1‘;

Live sulphur mix, with tar’s black-streaming Juice,

Or temper pitch that Id‘a's pines produce;

Or mingle‚ fraught with fat, the waxen store, 555'

Or sea-born squills‚ with potent hellcbore.

But the best cure wh‘ich‘ fage experience knows,

Is with a lance the ulcer to disclose.

‘still grows the sore, while yet the ffiepherd stand& ’

Doubtful, nor dares ‘exeri his heading hamb, 560 '

And anxious> happier' fi'g'ns of heav'n demands. Ξ

, But when o’cr th’ inmost bones th'e pain hath spread,

ἦ On their parch’fl limbs a raging fever fed3

To quell the blenting sufferer's torrid pain,

Pierce in the bottom-foot the th'robbing vein : 563

ι This pracffise the Bisaltae, when they haste

’ To Rhodope, or roam the ebear-less Dacian· waste:

ᾖ And fier-ce Gelonian, when, for savage f00d‚

ἶ He blends the milky stream with horse's blood.

ἰ If one thou seest affe& the cooling ffiade, 570
Or cropping listlessly the topmost blade5

Droop on the plain, with ling'ring paces wait

Behind‚ and home return alone and late3

Soon let thy steel remove th’ infeaf'ted sheep,

’ Lest o’er th' unwary flock contagion creep. 575

Less fierce and frequent on the wintry main

Black whirlwindss ruffi, than plagues that waste the plain ;

Nor fingle deaths suffice, at once they prey

On young and old, and sweep whole herds away.

This truth to know, ‘ch’ aeria} Alps behold, 580
