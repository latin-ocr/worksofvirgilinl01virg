Book 3. THE G130Ro1cs or Vmcu„ 335

And Noric cliffs with spiry castles crown’d3

Lo ! waste and wild the plains appear around :

Ev'n now deserted stands the shepherd's state,

And far and wide the lawns are desolate. 585
Here sprung of old by fickly gales begot‚

A plague with all the fires of autumn fraught,

Which ssew the beasts that range the field or w00d‚
Defil’d the frestmess of the crystal flood, }
And scorch’d with baleful breath the graffy food. 590
Strange kind of death ἔ for when the parching pain

Had {hrunk the limbs, and throbb’d in every veiu,

A pois’nous humour flow’d from all the frasne,

Till every bone one putrid mass became.

Before the shrine, in snowy fillets drest, 595
And holy bands, the consecrated beast }
Fell, and prevented oft the lingering priest-

Or if he sunk beneath the fatal stroke,

Lo ! on the ffirine, his entrails fail to smoke.

No more, missed by many a doubtful sign, 600
The prophet can the dark event divine3

While scarce the knife with the faint tineture reeks,
Nor the thin gore the sandy surface streaks.

O’er flow’ry meads, or at the plenteous stall,

In lifeless heaps, the calves and heifers fall. 605
The gentle dogs run mad3 the fick'ning swine

Pant with thick coughs, with swelling quinfies pine.
The vietor horse, forgetful of his food,

'· The palm remmroees, and abhors the flood τ

quits himself on a subjecit, so exceedingly difficult to be describ·

ι ed, and let us compare it with a fingularly fine one in Lucretius
of the same kind :

Perturbata animi mens in moerore metuque3
Trzstefitpercilium, furiofics vultus, {3⁹ acer,
sollicitae porro, plenaeque sonoribus aures .-
Creber spiritus, aut ingens, raroque coortm,
‘sennia stulta, minuta, croci remim-Pa colore,
Salsaqsaec perfatcccs raucas *vix edita tuffi'.
