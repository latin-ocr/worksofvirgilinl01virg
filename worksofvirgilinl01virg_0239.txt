Book 1. THE GnoRorcs or Vmort. ’ 207

When bent betimes, and tam'd the stubborn bough,
Tough elm receives the figure of the plough 3

Eight foot the bearn, alcumbrous length appears3 200
The earth—boards double3 double are the ears ;

Light to the yoke the linden feels the wound,

And the tall beech lies stretcht along the ground3

They fall for staves that gulde the plough-share's course,
And heat and hardening smoke confirm their force. 205
More ancjent precepts could I fing, but sear

Such homely rules may grate thy nicer ear.

To press the chalky floor more closely down,

Roll o’er its furface a cylindric stone3

Elsef ‘thro' the loosen’d dust, and chinky ground, 210
The grass springs forth, and vermin will abound.

Oft working low in earth the tiny mouse

Her garners makes, and builds her secret house3

Their nests and chambers scoop, the eyeless moles,

And swelling toads that haunt the darksome holes 3 213
The weasel heaps consumes, or prudent ant

Provides her copious stores, 'gainst age or want.

Mark likewise when in groves the almond blows,

And bends with luxury of flow’rs his boughs ;

If fruit abeund, the corn alike will thrive, 2¹20
And toil immense the copious threshing give 5

But if with full exuberance of ffiade,

The clustering leaves a barren foliage spread,

Then will the chaffy stalks‚ so lean and poor,

In vain be trampled on the hungry floor. 225
Some prudent sowers have I seen indeed

Steep with preventive care the manag'd seed,

In nitro, and black lees of oil ; to make

The swelling pods a larger body take :

But the well-disciplin'd‚ and chosen grains, 230
Tho' quicken’d o’er ssow fires with {kilful paim,

‘Starve and degenerate in the fattest plain5‚

carran, &t'alparum venenum. Thus says Varro, from whom 'tis
plaxn Vrrgn borrow’d 'this precept, as he has done many others.
