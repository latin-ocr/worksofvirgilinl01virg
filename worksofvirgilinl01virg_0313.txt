Book 2. Tm: Gssokcxcs or Vntcn„ 279

Nor wear the tiffu’d garment’s cumb'rous pride,

Nor seek soft wool in Syrian purple dy'd,

Nor with fantastic luxury defile

The native sweetness of the liquid oil ; 565
Yet calm content, secure from guilty cares,

Yet home-felt pleasure, peace, and rest, are theirs;
Leisure and ease, in groves, and cooling vales,
Grottoes, and bubbling brwks, and darksom dales;

And winding rivers, and inglorious ease ,¹

be the poet's enqulry where these places are fituated‚ tho' most
of the transsators take it s03 but it is an ardent wilh to be

laced in such delightful retreats. Cacrou, and the learned
R‘l. Haec, bishop of Avrauches, read O ubi Tempe, instead of
campi, which is most connstent with the paffage.
