But when the frolic Zephyrs breathe the spring,
Both flocks abroad to verdant pastures bring.
When now the morning-star but dimly dawns,¹
Lead them to taste the coolness of the lawns;
When hoar' with virgin dew the grass appearS, 40 5
Haste, let them drink the morning's earliest tears.
When the fierce sun grows hot with parching ray,
And woods resound the ffirill cicada's lay3

. Then drive them to fresh springs, their thirst to {lake ;

To troughs of oak, or to the spreading lake ε 410
But at mid-nom, to green and gloorny glades ς

where some tall oak uprears his aged shades ς

Or where the ilex-forest, dark and deep

Sheds holy horrors o’er the hanging steep.

Again refresh them, with their verdant food, 415
When finks the sun, and with the crystal flood,

When evening airs their cooling damps diffuse,

And Cynthia bathes the groves in balmy dews;

When thro’ the brakes is heard th' acanthis' song,

And halcyons chaunt the hollow {hores among. 420

. Why ihould I sing of Libya's artless szvains ;

Her scatter’d cottages‚ and trackless plains ?

By day, by night, without a destin’d home,

For many a month their flocks all lonely roam 3

So vast th' unbounded solitude appear& 425
While, with his klock, his all the {hepherd bears:

His arms, his houshold gods, his homely ffied,
His Cretan darts, and dogs of Sparta bred.
