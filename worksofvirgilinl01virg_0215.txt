Ecl. ιο. THE EcLocm-:s OF VIRGIL. 183

May Gallus view the song with partia] eyes,

For whom each hour my flames of friendship rise 3

Fast as when, verna} gales their influence spread,

The verdant alder lifts his blooming head.

But haste, unwholsorne to the loitering swain 100
The shades are found, and hurtful to the grain ;

Ev'n juniper’s sweet made, whose leaves around
Fragrance diffuse, at eve are noxious found.

Homeward, ye well-fed goats‚ now finks the day 3

Lo, glittering Hesper comes ἔ my goats away. 105
