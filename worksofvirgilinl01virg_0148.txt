was said to come from an issand in the Red Sea.

54. Oprogeny of Jove] Would it have been proper to be-
ssow these iilustrious appellations on a son of Pollio? Surely
virgil does not here pour them forth without reason. But
what young prince could at thaetime deserve to be called
the child of the gods, and the illustrious offspring of Jupiter?
KVithout doubt it must have been one of the family of the
Caesam ἱ And did there at that time come into the world any
child of the family of the Caesam, except young Marcellus?
