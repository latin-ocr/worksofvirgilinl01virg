mador, except something of the pathetic be added, by
the following remarks on a sister art.

‘⁶ The finest landscape of Titian or Canache, does not
interest the beholder more than would the real prospe& of
a village in a disagreeable or pleasant country. There is
nothing in such a pidture that speaks to one, ifI may
be allowed the expreffion. And as it does not touch the
beart, it cannot gain the attention. The best painters
were so well convinced of this nuth, that they have very
seldom given us landscapes wholly desert, and without
human figures ³¹⁶. They have peopled their pietures5
they have introduced into them persons employed in some
a&ion capable of moving us, and by consequence of en·
gaging our attention. This is the constant praestice of
Pouffin, Rubens, and the other great masters, who do
not think it sufficient to place in their landscapes a man
paffing on the road, or perhaps a countrywoman carrying
her fruits to maritet. They introduce men agitated with
paffions, in order to excite θυι-5, and by such an emotion
to interest us and engage our attention. In effe& the
figures introduced in these picfftures‚ are more frequently
mentioned and talked of, than their trees or terraffes.

Adjoin'd, from each thing met conceives delight‚
The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,

Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound;

If chance with nymphlike step fair virgin pass,
What pleafing seem’d, ‘Fon Ηεκ now pleases more3
She most, and in her look sums all delight.

Paradise Lost, Β. 9. ν. 445.

The beholder’s delight is doubled, at the appearance of this
living beauty.
