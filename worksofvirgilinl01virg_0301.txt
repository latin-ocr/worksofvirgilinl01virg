Book 2. Tm: Gssonorcs oF Vincn.. 267

No vines, hereafter, sow’d, or prun'd, will thrive 3
The bitter-Ieav'd wild olives sole survive. 385
Let none persuade to plant, in winter hoar,

When rigid Boreas’ spirit blusters frore 3

Winter the pores of earth so closely binds,

No passage the too tender fibre finds3

Plant best the vines, in blushing spring’s fresh bloom, 390
When the white bird, the dread of snakes, is come :

Or in cool autumn, when the summer's past,

Ere Phoebus' steeds to the cold tropic haste.

In spring, in blushing spring, the woods resume
Their leafy honours, and their fragrant bloom 3 39 5
Earth swells with moisture all her teeming lands,

A genial frucfflfying seed demands;

Almighty Jove descends, more full of life,

On the warm bosom of his kindling wife 3

The birds with mufic fill the pathless groves,· 400
Stung by defire the beasts renew their loves;

The buried grain appears, the fields unbind

Their pregnant bosoms to the western wind;

The springing grass to trust this season dares;

No tender vine the gathering tempests fears, 405
By the black north or roaring Auster roll’d,

But spreads her leaves, and bids her gems unfold.

Such were the days, the season was the same,

When first arose this world's all-beauteous frame 3

The sky was cloudless, balmy was the air, 410
And spring's mild influence made young nature fair:

is indeed infinitely obliged, are very fine3 he is likewise speak-
{ng of the genial influence of the spring ε

Hinc laetas urbes pueris florere videmus,
frondiferasque nevis avibus canere undique sylvas.
Hinc feſjZze pecudes pingues per pabula laeta
Corpora deponunt, et candens [aereus humor
Uberibus manat distentiu hinc nova proles
Artibus infirmis teneras lasciva per herbas

Ludit lade mer-0, mentes percuffiz novellas,

404. The ascribin g boldness and sear to trees is highly poetical.
