¹¹'Book 3. THE GzeRmcs 01·- Vmonza 30'1

κ Without thine aid no fancy fires my breast3 60

, Haste, let us burst the hands of idle rest.

Hark, from afar Cythaeron's voice I hear,

ἱ Taygetus’ opening dogs my spirits chear ;

With neighing steeds tall Epidaure resounds;

3 From the deep groves the doubling din rebounds. 65
’, The time may come, when my maturet muse

Augustus’ glowing fights her theme {hall choose:

‚q And thro’ more ages bid his glory last,

‘ Than have from Tithon’ss birth to Caesar past.

The youth, who studious of th’ Olympio meed, 70

[i And fond of fame, would rear the stately steed 3
Or bend the sturdy bussock to the share,

Ἴ Must choose the dam with nice sagacious care.

, ῈίτΡε, by these marks sele& thy mother-cour,

A clumsy head, bfo-ad neck, and lowering brow: 75
Her double dew-laps from her chin must rise‚

In spacious folds descending o’er her thighs :

Be her’s a disproporrion’d length of fide,

Her limbs al] fram⁷d with vast unwieldy pride :

, Let tufts of hair her :ample feet adorn, 82
’ Rough be her ear, and wreath’d her bending horn :

Nor less her worth, if o'er her jetty skin,

Some random spots of snowy white be seen3

Or if {he aim a blow, or spurn the yoke,

Or wear a stem—brow’d bull’s rough threatening look. 85
Majestic she must wall: with lofty mien,

And proudly sweep with length of tail the green.

ι When now four years have steel'd her lusty frame,

Then let her prove kind Hymen’s mutual flame τ
At ten release her ; now no more to prove 90

· The tbils of culture, or the joys of love.
· Mean time, while warm‘ch of youthful blood prevaiIS‚

To the soft bliss admit thy sprightly males ε
Let their first vigour try the fierce embrace;
So herds sslall rise on herds, and race on race- 95
