Del. 1. THE EcrooUEs oF VIRGIL. 81

Careless I liv’d of freedom and of gain,
And frequent vicffrims thinn'd myssfolds in v'ain3
Tho’ to th' ungrateful town my cheese Ι sold, 43
Yet still Ι, bore not back th’ expecTted gold.
MELIBoEUs.
Ost, Amaryllis, I with wonder heard
Thy vows to heav'n in soft distress preferr’d.
With wonder oft thy lingering fruits survey'd ;
Nor knew for whom the bending branehes stay'd ε 30
'Twas Tit'rus was away—for thee detain'd

¹ The pines, the 1hrubs‚ the bubbling springs complain'd.

TITYRUS.
What could I do? where else expe& to find
One glimpse of freedorn, or a god so kind ?
There I that youth behem, for whom shall rise 55
Each year my votive incense to the fides. ¹
'Twas there this gracious answer bless'd mine ears,
Swains feed again your herds, and yoke your, steers.

MELIBOEUS.
Happy old man ! then still thy famis restor’d,
, Enough for thee, shall bless thy frugal board. bu

What tho’ rough stones the naked soil o'erspread,

Or marihy bulrush rear its watry head,

No foreign food thy teeming ewes {hall sear,

No touch contagious spread its influence here.

Happy old man ! here mid' the custom’d streams 65
And sacred springs, you’ll ssiun the scOrching beams,

’ While from yon wiliow-fencc‚ thy pastures’ bound,
The bees that suck their flow'ry stores amand,

shall sweetly mingle, with the whispering boughs,

ι Their lulling mrstrnurs, and invite repose : 70.

ι think Virgil is here describing his own estate. 'Tis a mistake
toffmagine the spot of ground was barren, for we find it con-
tamed a vineyard and apiary‚ and good pasture land3 and the
sszepherd says he supplied Mantua with vierims and cheeses.
