ECLOGUE THE SIXTH.

ARGUMENT.

'This piece is perhaps one of the most beautiful of all the ten
Eclogues. V irgil addreffi's it to V arus his friend and fel-
lowstudent under the celebrated Syro an Epicurean philoso-
pher. Two shepherds are introduced, who seizo Silenus
steeping in a grotto, and compel him, with the afflstance of
a water nymph, to entertain them with a song he had often
promzsed them. ‘The god immediately begins to give them
an account of the formation of things, and lays before
them the Jjstem of Epicurus's philosophy both natural ancl
moral 3 which lest eircumstance was never thought of or
understood by any one transsator or commentator before Ca·

vtrou. sffter Silenus has told them how the world was ⁷
made accarding to the doctrine of Epicurus, his adj ungit
Hylax-115 that is, say the cristes, he recounted the most
famous ancient fcsshles, and some fizrprz'zing transformations
that had happened in the world. How absurd and unlike
the regularity and exaamss of V irgil s The meaning seems
to be, ——that after Silenos had done with the natural, he en-
tered upon the moral philosophy of Epicurus: which con-
sssed in teaching men to avoid all outrageous paffions and
violent perturbations of mind. This was the reason that he
sung to them the immoderate gritf of Hercules for the
hoy Hylas, the hrtttal lust of Pafiphae', the vanity of the'
Proetides, the avarice of Atalanta, and the immoderate
grief of the fisters ‘ff Phae'ton. All which the Epicuream
condemned as enemies to that quiet¹ andsoft repo-se which they
{steemed the perfea‘tion of virtue and happiness.
